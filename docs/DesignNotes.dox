Design notes on this project.

Here we describe common design aspects and patterns used in the project. To 
have an idea on all fits together you may look into @ref transformations.

@sa @ref transformations

@{
*/

/**
@defgroup resource Resource

A Resource is a type where its memory is controlled by SDL, usually with
functions like `SDL_Create*()` and `SDL_Destroy*()`.
*/

/**
@defgroup callback Callback

A callback is a invocable object passed to a function as a customization point.


@{
*/

/**
@defgroup SyncCallback Immediate callback

Immediate callback or synchronous callback is always invoked before the callee
function returns. Because of this, there is no need to be store/marshal data
as @ref AsyncCallback does.
*/

/**
@defgroup AsyncCallback Delayed callback

Delayed or Asynchronous callback is a callback that may be invoked after the 
callee returns. This might be when some event occurs or when a given result 
available.
@{
*/

/**
@defgroup ResultCallback Result callback

Result callback is invoked at single point and then discarded. This means that
after its called it safe to free any memory it is holding. The CallbackWrapper 
is perfect to safely wrap it and avoid dangling pointer. An example of such 
uses is RunOnMainThread().
*/

/**
@defgroup ListenerCallback Listener callback

Listener callback is invoked multiple times whenever the event it subscripted
happens. It's not safe to free memory after call, so a separate mechanism must
be provided.

When there is a single listener per program, like SetEventFilter(), you we can
use UniqueWrapper, which makes sure only a single one per type exists.

When there can be just a single callback listening per resource we can use 
KeyValueWrapper with a Resource pointer as key. An example of this technique is
in WindowBase::SetHitTest(HitTestFunction). We need to make sure we call 
KeyValueWrapper.erase() on the equivalent `*.Destroy()` function, again the 
example is WindowBase::Destroy().

When there is multiple callbacks simultaneously per program, we can use a 
combination of CallbackWrapper to wrap it and KeyValueWrapper to 
associate them with an id you can later use to remove it, as we use in both
AddEventWatch() and AddTimer().

@todo Allow listener handle to be stored into a RAII object.
