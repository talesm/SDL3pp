/**
 * @defgroup CategoryAssert Assertions
 *
 * A helpful assertion macro!
 *
 * SDL assertions operate like your usual `assert` macro, but with some added
 * features:
 *
 * - It uses a trick with the `sizeof` operator, so disabled assertions
 *   vaporize out of the compiled code, but variables only referenced in the
 *   assertion won't trigger compiler warnings about being unused.
 * - It is safe to use with a dangling-else: `if (x) SDL_assert(y); else
 *   do_something();`
 * - It works the same everywhere, instead of counting on various platforms'
 *   compiler and C runtime to behave.
 * - It provides multiple levels of assertion (SDL_assert, SDL_assert_release,
 *   SDL_assert_paranoid) instead of a single all-or-nothing option.
 * - It offers a variety of responses when an assertion fails (retry, trigger
 *   the debugger, abort the program, ignore the failure once, ignore it for
 *   the rest of the program's run).
 * - It tries to show the user a dialog by default, if possible, but the app
 *   can provide a callback to handle assertion failures however they like.
 * - It lets failed assertions be retried. Perhaps you had a network failure
 *   and just want to retry the test after plugging your network cable back
 *   in? You can.
 * - It lets the user ignore an assertion failure, if there's a harmless
 *   problem that one can continue past.
 * - It lets the user mark an assertion as ignored for the rest of the
 *   program's run; if there's a harmless problem that keeps popping up.
 * - It provides statistics and data on all failed assertions to the app.
 * - It allows the default assertion handler to be controlled with environment
 *   variables, in case an automated script needs to control it.
 * - It can be used as an aid to Clang's static analysis; it will treat SDL
 *   assertions as universally true (under the assumption that you are serious
 *   about the asserted claims and that your debug builds will detect when
 *   these claims were wrong). This can help the analyzer avoid false
 *   positives.
 *
 * To use it: compile a debug build and just sprinkle around tests to check
 * your code!

/**
 * @brief Compose a custom blend mode for renderers.
 *
 * The functions SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode and SDL_SetTextureBlendMode accept
 * the SDL_BlendMode returned by this function if the renderer supports it.
 *
 * A blend mode controls how the pixels from a drawing operation (source) get
 * combined with the pixels from the render target (destination). First, the
 * components of the source and destination pixels get multiplied with their
 * blend factors. Then, the blend operation takes the two products and
 * calculates the result that will get stored in the render target.
 *
 * Expressed in pseudocode, it would look like this:
 *
 * ```c
 * dstRGB = colorOperation(srcRGB * srcColorFactor, dstRGB * dstColorFactor);
 * dstA = alphaOperation(srcA * srcAlphaFactor, dstA * dstAlphaFactor);
 * ```
 *
 * Where the functions `colorOperation(src, dst)` and `alphaOperation(src,
 * dst)` can return one of the following:
 *
 * - `src + dst`
 * - `src - dst`
 * - `dst - src`
 * - `min(src, dst)`
 * - `max(src, dst)`
 *
 * The red, green, and blue components are always multiplied with the first,
 * second, and third components of the SDL_BlendFactor, respectively. The
 * fourth component is not used.
 *
 * The alpha component is always multiplied with the fourth component of the
 * SDL_BlendFactor. The other components are not used in the alpha
 * calculation.
 *
 * Support for these blend modes varies for each renderer. To check if a
 * specific SDL_BlendMode is supported, create a renderer and pass it to
 * either SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode or SDL_SetTextureBlendMode. They will
 * return with an error if the blend mode is not supported.
 *
 * This list describes the support of custom blend modes for each renderer.
 * All renderers support the four blend modes listed in the SDL_BlendMode
 * enumeration.
 *
 * - **direct3d**: Supports all operations with all factors. However, some
 *   factors produce unexpected results with `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MINIMUM` and
 *   `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MAXIMUM`.
 * - **direct3d11**: Same as Direct3D 9.
 * - **opengl**: Supports the `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD` operation with all
 *   factors. OpenGL versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 do not work correctly here.
 * - **opengles2**: Supports the `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD`,
 *   `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_SUBTRACT`, `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_REV_SUBTRACT`
 *   operations with all factors.
 * - **psp**: No custom blend mode support.
 * - **software**: No custom blend mode support.
 *
 * Some renderers do not provide an alpha component for the default render
 * target. The `SDL_BLENDFACTOR_DST_ALPHA` and
 * `SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA` factors do not have an effect in this
 * case.
 *
 * @param srcColorFactor the SDL_BlendFactor applied to the red, green, and
 *                       blue components of the source pixels.
 * @param dstColorFactor the SDL_BlendFactor applied to the red, green, and
 *                       blue components of the destination pixels.

 *                       green, and blue components of the source and
 *                       destination pixels.

 * HasSSE() or HasNEON(). Otherwise, the process might crash for using an
 * unsupported CPU instruction.
 *
 * SDL only sets preprocessor defines for CPU intrinsics if they are
 * supported, so apps should check with `#ifdef` and not `#if`.
 *
 * SDL will also include the appropriate instruction-set-specific support

/**

 * @defgroup CategorySharedObject Shared Object/DLL Management
 *
 * System-dependent library loading routines.
 *
 * Shared objects are code that is programmatically loadable at runtime.
 * Windows calls these "DLLs", Linux calls them "shared libraries", etc.
 *
 * To use them, build such a library, then call SDL_LoadObject() on it. Once
 * loaded, you can use SDL_LoadFunction() on that object to find the address
 * of its exported symbols. When done with the object, call SDL_UnloadObject()
 * to dispose of it.
 *
 * Some things to keep in mind:
 *
 * - These functions only work on C function names. Other languages may have
 *   name mangling and intrinsic language support that varies from compiler to
 *   compiler.
 * - Make sure you declare your function pointers with the same calling
 *   convention as the actual library function. Your code will crash
 *   mysteriously if you do not do this.
 * - Avoid namespace collisions. If you load a symbol from the library, it is
 *   not defined whether or not it goes into the global symbol namespace for
 *   the application. If it does and it conflicts with symbols in your code or
 *   other shared libraries, you will not get the results you expect. :)
 * - Once a library is unloaded, all pointers into it obtained through
 *   SDL_LoadFunction() become invalid, even if the library is later reloaded.
 *   Don't unload a library if you plan to use these pointers in the future.
 *   Notably: beware of giving one of these pointers to atexit(), since it may
 *   call that pointer after the library unloads.

/**
 * @defgroup CategoryLog Log Handling
 *
 * Simple log messages with priorities and categories. A message's
 * LogPriority signifies how important the message is. A message's
 * LogCategory signifies from what domain it belongs to. Every category
 * has a minimum priority specified: when a message belongs to that category,
 * it will only be sent out if it has that minimum priority or higher.
 *
 * SDL's own logs are sent below the default priority threshold, so they are
 * quiet by default.
 *
 * You can change the log verbosity programmatically using
 * LogCategory.SetLogPriority() or with SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_LOGGING, ...), or
 * with the "SDL_LOGGING" environment variable. This variable is a comma
 * separated set of category=level tokens that define the default logging levels
 * for SDL applications.
 *
 * The category can be a numeric category, one of "app", "error", "assert",
 * "system", "audio", "video", "render", "input", "test", or `*` for any
 * unspecified category.
 *
 * The level can be a numeric level, one of "trace", "verbose", "debug",
 * "info", "warn", "error", "critical", or "quiet" to disable that category.
 *
 * You can omit the category if you want to set the logging level for all
 * categories.
 *
 * If this hint isn't set, the default log levels are equivalent to:
 *
 * `app=info,assert=warn,test=verbose,*=error`
 *
 * Here's where the messages go on different platforms:
 *
 * - Windows: debug output stream
 * - Android: log output
 * - Others: standard error output (stderr)
 *
 * You don't need to have a newline (`@n`) on the end of messages, the
 * functions will do that for you. For consistent behavior cross-platform, you
 * shouldn't have any newlines in messages, such as to log multiple lines in
 * one call; unusual platform-specific behavior can be observed in such usage.
 * Do one log call per line instead, with no newlines in messages.
 *
 * Each log call is atomic, so you won't see log messages cut off one another
 * when logging from multiple threads.

/**
 * @defgroup CategoryPixels Pixel Formats and Conversion Routines
 *
 * SDL offers facilities for pixel management.
 *
 * Largely these facilities deal with pixel _format_: what does this set of
 * bits represent?
 *
 * If you mostly want to think of a pixel as some combination of red, green,
 * blue, and maybe alpha intensities, this is all pretty straightforward, and
 * in many cases, is enough information to build a perfectly fine game.
 *
 * However, the actual definition of a pixel is more complex than that:
 *
 * Pixels are a representation of a color in a particular color space.
 *
 * The first characteristic of a color space is the color type. SDL
 * understands two different color types, RGB and YCbCr, or in SDL also
 * referred to as YUV.
 *
 * RGB colors consist of red, green, and blue channels of color that are added
 * together to represent the colors we see on the screen.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model
 *
 * YCbCr colors represent colors as a Y luma brightness component and red and
 * blue chroma color offsets. This color representation takes advantage of the
 * fact that the human eye is more sensitive to brightness than the color in
 * an image. The Cb and Cr components are often compressed and have lower
 * resolution than the luma component.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr
 *
 * When the color information in YCbCr is compressed, the Y pixels are left at
 * full resolution and each Cr and Cb pixel represents an average of the color
 * information in a block of Y pixels. The chroma location determines where in
 * that block of pixels the color information is coming from.
 *
 * The color range defines how much of the pixel to use when converting a
 * pixel into a color on the display. When the full color range is used, the
 * entire numeric range of the pixel bits is significant. When narrow color
 * range is used, for historical reasons, the pixel uses only a portion of the
 * numeric range to represent colors.
 *
 * The color primaries and white point are a definition of the colors in the
 * color space relative to the standard XYZ color space.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space
 *
 * The transfer characteristic, or opto-electrical transfer function (OETF),
 * is the way a color is converted from mathematically linear space into a
 * non-linear output signals.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec._709#Transfer_characteristics
 *
 * The matrix coefficients are used to convert between YCbCr and RGB colors.

/**
 * Pixel format.
 *
 * SDL's pixel formats have the following naming convention:
 *
 * - Names with a list of components and a single bit count, such as RGB24 and
 *   ABGR32, define a platform-independent encoding into bytes in the order
 *   specified. For example, in RGB24 data, each pixel is encoded in 3 bytes
 *   (red, green, blue) in that order, and in ABGR32 data, each pixel is
 *   encoded in 4 bytes alpha, blue, green, red) in that order. Use these
 *   names if the property of a format that is important to you is the order
 *   of the bytes in memory or on disk.
 * - Names with a bit count per component, such as ARGB8888 and XRGB1555, are
 *   "packed" into an appropriately-sized integer in the platform's native
 *   endianness. For example, ARGB8888 is a sequence of 32-bit integers; in
 *   each integer, the most significant bits are alpha, and the least
 *   significant bits are blue. On a little-endian CPU such as x86, the least
 *   significant bits of each integer are arranged first in memory, but on a
 *   big-endian CPU such as s390x, the most significant bits are arranged
 *   first. Use these names if the property of a format that is important to
 *   you is the meaning of each bit position within a native-endianness
 *   integer.
 * - In indexed formats such as INDEX4LSB, each pixel is represented by
 *   encoding an index into the palette into the indicated number of bits,
 *   with multiple pixels packed into each byte if appropriate. In LSB
 *   formats, the first (leftmost) pixel is stored in the least-significant
 *   bits of the byte; in MSB formats, it's stored in the most-significant
 *   bits. INDEX8 does not need LSB/MSB variants, because each pixel exactly
 *   fills one byte.
 *
 * The 32-bit byte-array encodings such as RGBA32 are aliases for the
 * appropriate 8888 encoding for the current platform. For example, RGBA32 is
 * an alias for ABGR8888 on little-endian CPUs like x86, or an alias for
 * RGBA8888 on big-endian CPUs.

/**
 * @defgroup CategoryInit Initialization and Shutdown
 *
 * All SDL programs need to initialize the library before starting to work
 * with it.
 *
 * Almost everything can simply call SDL_Init() near startup, with a handful
 * of flags to specify subsystems to touch. These are here to make sure SDL
 * does not even attempt to touch low-level pieces of the operating system
 * that you don't intend to use. For example, you might be using SDL for video
 * and input but chose an external library for audio, and in this case you
 * would just need to leave off the `SDL_INIT_AUDIO` flag to make sure that
 * external library has complete control.
 *
 * Most apps, when terminating, should call SDL_Quit(). This will clean up
 * (nearly) everything that SDL might have allocated, and crucially, it'll
 * make sure that the display's resolution is back to what the user expects if
 * you had previously changed it for your game.
 *
 * SDL3 apps are strongly encouraged to call SDL_SetAppMetadata() at startup
 * to fill in details about the program. This is completely optional, but it
 * helps in small ways (we can provide an About dialog box for the macOS menu,
 * we can name the app in the system's audio mixer, etc). Those that want to
 * provide a _lot_ of information should look at the more-detailed
 * SDL_SetAppMetadataProperty().

 *   anywhere the OS shows the name of the application separately from window
 *   titles, such as volume control applets, etc. This defaults to "SDL
 *   Application".
 * - `SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_VERSION_STRING`: The version of the app that is
 *   running; there are no rules on format, so "1.0.3beta2" and "April 22nd,
 *   2024" and a git hash are all valid options. This has no default.
 * - `SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_IDENTIFIER_STRING`: A unique string that
 *   identifies this app. This must be in reverse-domain format, like
 *   "com.example.mygame2". This string is used by desktop compositors to
 *   identify and group windows together, as well as match applications with
 *   associated desktop settings and icons. If you plan to package your
 *   application in a container such as Flatpak, the app ID should match the
 *   name of your Flatpak container as well. This has no default.
 * - `SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_CREATOR_STRING`: The human-readable name of the
 *   creator/developer/maker of this app, like "MojoWorkshop, LLC"
 * - `SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_COPYRIGHT_STRING`: The human-readable copyright
 *   notice, like "Copyright (c) 2024 MojoWorkshop, LLC" or whatnot. Keep this
 *   to one line, don't paste a copy of a whole software license in here. This
 *   has no default.
 * - `SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_URL_STRING`: A URL to the app on the web. Maybe a
 *   product page, or a storefront, or even a GitHub repository, for user's
 *   further information This has no default.
 * - `SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_TYPE_STRING`: The type of application this is.
 *   Currently this string can be "game" for a video game, "mediaplayer" for a
 *   media player, or generically "application" if nothing else applies.
 *   Future versions of SDL might add new types. This defaults to
 *   "application".
 *

   *   back to the end of file. The file is created if it does not exist.
   *
   * **NOTE**: In order to open a file as a binary file, a "b" character has to
   * be included in the `mode` string. This additional "b" character can either
   * be appended at the end of the string (thus making the following compound
   * modes: "rb", "wb", "ab", "r+b", "w+b", "a+b") or be inserted between the
   * letter and the "+" sign for the mixed modes ("rb+", "wb+", "ab+").

   * format, regardless of the underlying operating system.
   *
   * In Android, SDL_IOFromFile() can be used to open content:// URIs. As a
   * fallback, SDL_IOFromFile() will transparently open a matching filename in
   * the app's `assets`.
   *
   * Closing the SDL_IOStream will close SDL's internal file handle.
   *
   * The following properties may be set at creation time by SDL:
   *
   * - `SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_WINDOWS_HANDLE_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast

   * - `SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_STDIO_FILE_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast to a
   *   stdio `FILE *`, that this SDL_IOStream is using to access the filesystem.
   *   If SDL used some other method to access the filesystem, this property
   *   will not be set. PLEASE NOTE that if SDL is using a different C runtime
   *   than your app, trying to use this pointer will almost certainly result in
   *   a crash! This is mostly a problem on Windows; make sure you build SDL and
   *   your app with the same compiler and settings to avoid it.
   * - `SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_FILE_DESCRIPTOR_NUMBER`: a file descriptor that this
   *   SDL_IOStream is using to access the filesystem.
   * - `SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_ANDROID_AASSET_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast
   *   to an Android NDK `AAsset *`, that this SDL_IOStream is using to access
   *   the filesystem. If SDL used some other method to access the filesystem,
   *   this property will not be set.
   *
   * @param file a UTF-8 string representing the filename to open.

/**
 * @defgroup CategoryVideo Display and Window Management
 *
 * SDL's video subsystem is largely interested in abstracting window
 * management from the underlying operating system. You can create windows,
 * manage them in various ways, set them fullscreen, and get events when
 * interesting things happen with them, such as the mouse or keyboard
 * interacting with a window.
 *
 * The video subsystem is also interested in abstracting away some
 * platform-specific differences in OpenGL: context creation, swapping
 * buffers, etc. This may be crucial to your app, but also you are not
 * required to use OpenGL at all. In fact, SDL can provide rendering to those
 * windows as well, either with an easy-to-use
 * [2D API](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryRender)
 * or with a more-powerful
 * [GPU API](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryGPU)
 * . Of course, it can simply get out of your way and give you the window
 * handles you need to use Vulkan, Direct3D, Metal, or whatever else you like
 * directly, too.
 *
 * The video subsystem covers a lot of functionality, out of necessity, so it
 * is worth perusing the list of functions just to see what's available, but
 * most apps can get by with simply creating a window and listening for
 * events, so start with SDL_CreateWindow() and SDL_PollEvent().

 *
 * There are some quirks to looking up OpenGL functions that require some
 * extra care from the application. If you code carefully, you can handle
 * these quirks without any platform-specific code, though:
 *
 * - On Windows, function pointers are specific to the current GL context;
 *   this means you need to have created a GL context and made it current
 *   before calling SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(). If you recreate your context or
 *   create a second context, you should assume that any existing function
 *   pointers aren't valid to use with it. This is (currently) a
 *   Windows-specific limitation, and in practice lots of drivers don't suffer
 *   this limitation, but it is still the way the wgl API is documented to
 *   work and you should expect crashes if you don't respect it. Store a copy
 *   of the function pointers that comes and goes with context lifespan.
 * - On X11, function pointers returned by this function are valid for any
 *   context, and can even be looked up before a context is created at all.
 *   This means that, for at least some common OpenGL implementations, if you
 *   look up a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-NULL result that
 *   is _NOT_ safe to call. You must always make sure the function is actually
 *   available for a given GL context before calling it, by checking for the
 *   existence of the appropriate extension with SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported(),
 *   or verifying that the version of OpenGL you're using offers the function
 *   as core functionality.
 * - Some OpenGL drivers, on all platforms, *will* return NULL if a function
 *   isn't supported, but you can't count on this behavior. Check for
 *   extensions you use, and if you get a NULL anyway, act as if that
 *   extension wasn't available. This is probably a bug in the driver, but you
 *   can code defensively for this scenario anyhow.
 * - Just because you're on Linux/Unix, don't assume you'll be using X11.
 *   Next-gen display servers are waiting to replace it, and may or may not
 *   make the same promises about function pointers.
 * - OpenGL function pointers must be declared `APIENTRY` as in the example
 *   code. This will ensure the proper calling convention is followed on
 *   platforms where this matters (Win32) thereby avoiding stack corruption.
 *
 * @param proc the name of an OpenGL function.

 *
 * File dialog support.
 *
 * SDL offers file dialogs, to let users select files with native GUI
 * interfaces. There are "open" dialogs, "save" dialogs, and folder selection
 * dialogs. The app can control some details, such as filtering to specific
 * files, or whether multiple files can be selected by the user.
 *
 * Note that launching a file dialog is a non-blocking operation; control
 * returns to the app immediately, and a callback is called later (possibly in
 * another thread) when the user makes a choice.
 *
 * @{
 */

/**
 * An entry for filters for file dialogs.
 *
 * `name` is a user-readable label for the filter (for example, "Office
 * document").
 *
 * `pattern` is a semicolon-separated list of file extensions (for example,
 * "doc;docx"). File extensions may only contain alphanumeric characters,
 * hyphens, underscores and periods. Alternatively, the whole string can be a
 * single asterisk ("*"), which serves as an "All files" filter.
 *

 * - `SDL_PROP_FILE_DIALOG_TITLE_STRING`: the title for the dialog.
 * - `SDL_PROP_FILE_DIALOG_ACCEPT_STRING`: the label that the accept button
 *   should have.

/**

 *
 * Event queue management.
 *
 * It's extremely common--often required--that an app deal with SDL's event
 * queue. Almost all useful information about interactions with the real world
 * flow through here: the user interacting with the computer and app, hardware
 * coming and going, the system changing in some way, etc.
 *
 * An app generally takes a moment, perhaps at the start of a new frame, to
 * examine any events that have occurred since the last time and process or
 * ignore them. This is generally done by calling SDL_PollEvent() in a loop
 * until it returns false (or, if using the main callbacks, events are
 * provided one at a time in calls to SDL_AppEvent() before the next call to
 * SDL_AppIterate(); in this scenario, the app does not call PollEvent()
 * at all).
 *
 * There is other forms of control, too: PeepEvents() has more
 * functionality at the cost of more complexity, and WaitEvent() can block
 * the process until something interesting happens, which might be beneficial
 * for certain types of programs on low-power hardware. One may also call
 * AddEventWatch() to set a callback when new events arrive.
 *
 * The app is free to generate their own events, too: PushEvent() allows the
 * app to put events onto the queue for later retrieval; RegisterEvents()
 * can guarantee that these events have a type that isn't in use by other
 * parts of the system.

 * should use SDL's OpenGL/Direct3D support, the SDL3 GPU API, or one of the
 * many good 3D engines.
 *
