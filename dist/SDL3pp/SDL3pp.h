 *
 * These strings are maintained per-thread, and apps are welcome to set their
 * own errors, which is popular when building libraries on top of SDL for
 * other apps to consume. These strings are set by calling SDL_SetError().
 *
 * A common usage pattern is to have a function that returns true for success
 * and false for failure, and do this when something fails:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * if (something_went_wrong) {
 *    return SDL::SetError("The thing broke in this specific way: {}", errcode);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * It's also common to just return `false` in this case if the failing thing
 * is known to call SetError(), so errors simply propagate through.

/**
 * @defgroup CategoryAssert Assertions
 *
 * A helpful assertion macro!
 *
 * SDL assertions operate like your usual `assert` macro, but with some added
 * features:
 *
 * - It uses a trick with the `sizeof` operator, so disabled assertions
 *   vaporize out of the compiled code, but variables only referenced in the
 *   assertion won't trigger compiler warnings about being unused.
 * - It is safe to use with a dangling-else: `if (x) SDL_assert(y); else
 *   do_something();`
 * - It works the same everywhere, instead of counting on various platforms'
 *   compiler and C runtime to behave.
 * - It provides multiple levels of assertion (SDL_assert, SDL_assert_release,
 *   SDL_assert_paranoid) instead of a single all-or-nothing option.
 * - It offers a variety of responses when an assertion fails (retry, trigger
 *   the debugger, abort the program, ignore the failure once, ignore it for
 *   the rest of the program's run).
 * - It tries to show the user a dialog by default, if possible, but the app
 *   can provide a callback to handle assertion failures however they like.
 * - It lets failed assertions be retried. Perhaps you had a network failure
 *   and just want to retry the test after plugging your network cable back
 *   in? You can.
 * - It lets the user ignore an assertion failure, if there's a harmless
 *   problem that one can continue past.
 * - It lets the user mark an assertion as ignored for the rest of the
 *   program's run; if there's a harmless problem that keeps popping up.
 * - It provides statistics and data on all failed assertions to the app.
 * - It allows the default assertion handler to be controlled with environment
 *   variables, in case an automated script needs to control it.
 * - It can be used as an aid to Clang's static analysis; it will treat SDL
 *   assertions as universally true (under the assumption that you are serious
 *   about the asserted claims and that your debug builds will detect when
 *   these claims were wrong). This can help the analyzer avoid false
 *   positives.
 *
 * To use it: compile a debug build and just sprinkle around tests to check
 * your code!

/**
 * @brief Compose a custom blend mode for renderers.
 *
 * The functions SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode and SDL_SetTextureBlendMode accept
 * the SDL_BlendMode returned by this function if the renderer supports it.
 *
 * A blend mode controls how the pixels from a drawing operation (source) get
 * combined with the pixels from the render target (destination). First, the
 * components of the source and destination pixels get multiplied with their
 * blend factors. Then, the blend operation takes the two products and
 * calculates the result that will get stored in the render target.
 *
 * Expressed in pseudocode, it would look like this:
 *
 * ```c
 * dstRGB = colorOperation(srcRGB * srcColorFactor, dstRGB * dstColorFactor);
 * dstA = alphaOperation(srcA * srcAlphaFactor, dstA * dstAlphaFactor);
 * ```
 *
 * Where the functions `colorOperation(src, dst)` and `alphaOperation(src,
 * dst)` can return one of the following:
 *
 * - `src + dst`
 * - `src - dst`
 * - `dst - src`
 * - `min(src, dst)`
 * - `max(src, dst)`
 *
 * The red, green, and blue components are always multiplied with the first,
 * second, and third components of the SDL_BlendFactor, respectively. The
 * fourth component is not used.
 *
 * The alpha component is always multiplied with the fourth component of the
 * SDL_BlendFactor. The other components are not used in the alpha
 * calculation.
 *
 * Support for these blend modes varies for each renderer. To check if a
 * specific SDL_BlendMode is supported, create a renderer and pass it to
 * either SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode or SDL_SetTextureBlendMode. They will
 * return with an error if the blend mode is not supported.
 *
 * This list describes the support of custom blend modes for each renderer.
 * All renderers support the four blend modes listed in the SDL_BlendMode
 * enumeration.
 *
 * - **direct3d**: Supports all operations with all factors. However, some
 *   factors produce unexpected results with `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MINIMUM` and
 *   `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MAXIMUM`.
 * - **direct3d11**: Same as Direct3D 9.
 * - **opengl**: Supports the `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD` operation with all
 *   factors. OpenGL versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 do not work correctly here.
 * - **opengles2**: Supports the `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD`,
 *   `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_SUBTRACT`, `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_REV_SUBTRACT`
 *   operations with all factors.
 * - **psp**: No custom blend mode support.
 * - **software**: No custom blend mode support.
 *
 * Some renderers do not provide an alpha component for the default render
 * target. The `SDL_BLENDFACTOR_DST_ALPHA` and
 * `SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA` factors do not have an effect in this
 * case.
 *
 * @param srcColorFactor the SDL_BlendFactor applied to the red, green, and
 *                       blue components of the source pixels.

 *                       blue components of the destination pixels.

/**
 *
 * @defgroup CategoryClipboard Clipboard Handling
 *
 * SDL provides access to the system clipboard, both for reading information
 * from other processes and publishing information of its own.
 *
 * This is not just text! SDL apps can access and publish data by mimetype.
 *
 * ## Basic use (text)
 *
 * Obtaining and publishing simple text to the system clipboard is as easy as
 * calling GetClipboardText() and SetClipboardText(), respectively.
 * These deal with C strings in UTF-8 encoding. Data transmission and encoding
 * conversion is completely managed by SDL.
 *
 * ## Clipboard callbacks (data other than text)
 *
 * Things get more complicated when the clipboard contains something other
 * than text. Not only can the system clipboard contain data of any type, in
 * some cases it can contain the same data in different formats! For example,
 * an image painting app might let the user copy a graphic to the clipboard,
 * and offers it in .BMP, .JPG, or .PNG format for other apps to consume.
 *
 * Obtaining clipboard data ("pasting") like this is a matter of calling
 * GetClipboardData() and telling it the mimetype of the data you want.
 * But how does one know if that format is available? HasClipboardData()
 * can report if a specific mimetype is offered, and
 * GetClipboardMimeTypes() can provide the entire list of mimetypes
 * available, so the app can decide what to do with the data and what formats
 * it can support.
 *
 * Setting the clipboard ("copying") to arbitrary data is done with
 * SetClipboardData. The app does not provide the data in this call, but
 * rather the mimetypes it is willing to provide and a callback function.
 * During the callback, the app will generate the data. This allows massive
 * data sets to be provided to the clipboard, without any data being copied
 * before it is explicitly requested. More specifically, it allows an app to
 * offer data in multiple formats without providing a copy of all of them
 * upfront. If the app has an image that it could provide in PNG or JPG
 * format, it doesn't have to encode it to either of those unless and until
 * something tries to paste it.
 *
 * ## Primary Selection
 *
 * The X11 and Wayland video targets have a concept of the "primary selection"
 * in addition to the usual clipboard. This is generally highlighted (but not
 * explicitly copied) text from various apps. SDL offers APIs for this through
 * GetPrimarySelectionText() and SetPrimarySelectionText(). SDL offers
 * these APIs on platforms without this concept, too, but only so far that it
 * will keep a copy of a string that the app sets for later retrieval; the
 * operating system will not ever attempt to change the string externally if
 * it doesn't support a primary selection.

 * Get the directory where the application was run from.

 * SDL caches the result of this call internally, but the first call to this

 *
 * **macOS and iOS Specific Functionality**: If the application is in a ".app"
 * bundle, this function returns the Resource directory (e.g.
 * MyApp.app/Contents/Resources/). This behaviour can be overridden by adding
 * a property to the Info.plist file. Adding a string key with the name
 * SDL_FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR_TYPE with a supported value will change the
 * behaviour.
 *
 * Supported values for the SDL_FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR_TYPE property (Given an
 * application in /Applications/SDLApp/MyApp.app):
 *
 * - `resource`: bundle resource directory (the default). For example:
 *   `/Applications/SDLApp/MyApp.app/Contents/Resources`
 * - `bundle`: the Bundle directory. For example:
 *   `/Applications/SDLApp/MyApp.app/`
 * - `parent`: the containing directory of the bundle. For example:
 *   `/Applications/SDLApp/`
 *
 * **Nintendo 3DS Specific Functionality**: This function returns "romfs"
 * directory of the application as it is uncommon to store resources outside
 * the executable. As such it is not a writable directory.
 *
 * The returned path is guaranteed to end with a path separator ('\\' on
 * Windows, '/' on most other platforms).
 *
 * @returns an absolute path in UTF-8 encoding to the application data
 *          directory. nullptr will be returned on error or when the platform
 *          doesn't implement this functionality, call GetError() for more

 *
 * This function will decide the appropriate location in the native

/**

 *
 * SDL does some preprocessor gymnastics to determine if any CPU-specific
 * compiler intrinsics are available, as this is not necessarily an easy thing
 * to calculate, and sometimes depends on quirks of a system, versions of
 * build tools, and other external forces.
 *
 * Apps including SDL's headers will be able to check consistent preprocessor
 * definitions to decide if it's safe to use compiler intrinsics for a
 * specific CPU architecture. This check only tells you that the compiler is
 * capable of using those intrinsics; at runtime, you should still check if
 * they are available on the current system with the
 * [CPU info functions](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryCPUInfo), such as
 * HasSSE() or HasNEON(). Otherwise, the process might crash for using an
 * unsupported CPU instruction.
 *
 * SDL only sets preprocessor defines for CPU intrinsics if they are
 * supported, so apps should check with `#ifdef` and not `#if`.
 *
 * SDL will also include the appropriate instruction-set-specific support
 * headers, so if SDL decides to define SDL_SSE2_INTRINSICS, it will also
 * `#include <emmintrin.h>` as well.

 *
 * The application is, on a whole, built without SSE2 instructions, so it will
 * run on Intel machines that don't support SSE2. But then at runtime, it
 * checks if the system supports the instructions, and then calls into a
 * function that uses SSE2 opcodes. The ifdefs make sure that this code isn't
 * used on platforms that don't have SSE2 at all.

/**
 *
 * @defgroup CategorySharedObject Shared Object/DLL Management
 *
 * System-dependent library loading routines.
 *
 * Shared objects are code that is programmatically loadable at runtime.
 * Windows calls these "DLLs", Linux calls them "shared libraries", etc.
 *
 * To use them, build such a library, then call SDL_LoadObject() on it. Once
 * loaded, you can use SDL_LoadFunction() on that object to find the address
 * of its exported symbols. When done with the object, call SDL_UnloadObject()
 * to dispose of it.
 *
 * Some things to keep in mind:
 *
 * - These functions only work on C function names. Other languages may have
 *   name mangling and intrinsic language support that varies from compiler to
 *   compiler.
 * - Make sure you declare your function pointers with the same calling
 *   convention as the actual library function. Your code will crash
 *   mysteriously if you do not do this.
 * - Avoid namespace collisions. If you load a symbol from the library, it is
 *   not defined whether or not it goes into the global symbol namespace for
 *   the application. If it does and it conflicts with symbols in your code or
 *   other shared libraries, you will not get the results you expect. :)
 * - Once a library is unloaded, all pointers into it obtained through
 *   SDL_LoadFunction() become invalid, even if the library is later reloaded.
 *   Don't unload a library if you plan to use these pointers in the future.
 *   Notably: beware of giving one of these pointers to atexit(), since it may
 *   call that pointer after the library unloads.

/**
 * @defgroup CategoryLog Log Handling
 *
 * Simple log messages with priorities and categories. A message's
 * LogPriority signifies how important the message is. A message's
 * LogCategory signifies from what domain it belongs to. Every category
 * has a minimum priority specified: when a message belongs to that category,
 * it will only be sent out if it has that minimum priority or higher.
 *
 * SDL's own logs are sent below the default priority threshold, so they are
 * quiet by default.
 *
 * You can change the log verbosity programmatically using
 * LogCategory.SetLogPriority() or with SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_LOGGING, ...), or
 * with the "SDL_LOGGING" environment variable. This variable is a comma
 * separated set of category=level tokens that define the default logging levels
 * for SDL applications.
 *
 * The category can be a numeric category, one of "app", "error", "assert",
 * "system", "audio", "video", "render", "input", "test", or `*` for any
 * unspecified category.
 *
 * The level can be a numeric level, one of "trace", "verbose", "debug",
 * "info", "warn", "error", "critical", or "quiet" to disable that category.
 *
 * You can omit the category if you want to set the logging level for all
 * categories.
 *
 * If this hint isn't set, the default log levels are equivalent to:
 *
 * `app=info,assert=warn,test=verbose,*=error`
 *
 * Here's where the messages go on different platforms:
 *
 * - Windows: debug output stream
 * - Android: log output
 * - Others: standard error output (stderr)
 *
 * You don't need to have a newline (`@n`) on the end of messages, the
 * functions will do that for you. For consistent behavior cross-platform, you
 * shouldn't have any newlines in messages, such as to log multiple lines in
 * one call; unusual platform-specific behavior can be observed in such usage.
 * Do one log call per line instead, with no newlines in messages.
 *
 * Each log call is atomic, so you won't see log messages cut off one another
 * when logging from multiple threads.

/**
 * @defgroup CategoryPixels Pixel Formats and Conversion Routines
 *
 * SDL offers facilities for pixel management.
 *
 * Largely these facilities deal with pixel _format_: what does this set of
 * bits represent?
 *
 * If you mostly want to think of a pixel as some combination of red, green,
 * blue, and maybe alpha intensities, this is all pretty straightforward, and
 * in many cases, is enough information to build a perfectly fine game.
 *
 * However, the actual definition of a pixel is more complex than that:
 *
 * Pixels are a representation of a color in a particular color space.
 *
 * The first characteristic of a color space is the color type. SDL
 * understands two different color types, RGB and YCbCr, or in SDL also
 * referred to as YUV.
 *
 * RGB colors consist of red, green, and blue channels of color that are added
 * together to represent the colors we see on the screen.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model
 *
 * YCbCr colors represent colors as a Y luma brightness component and red and
 * blue chroma color offsets. This color representation takes advantage of the
 * fact that the human eye is more sensitive to brightness than the color in
 * an image. The Cb and Cr components are often compressed and have lower
 * resolution than the luma component.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr
 *
 * When the color information in YCbCr is compressed, the Y pixels are left at
 * full resolution and each Cr and Cb pixel represents an average of the color
 * information in a block of Y pixels. The chroma location determines where in
 * that block of pixels the color information is coming from.
 *
 * The color range defines how much of the pixel to use when converting a
 * pixel into a color on the display. When the full color range is used, the
 * entire numeric range of the pixel bits is significant. When narrow color
 * range is used, for historical reasons, the pixel uses only a portion of the
 * numeric range to represent colors.
 *
 * The color primaries and white point are a definition of the colors in the
 * color space relative to the standard XYZ color space.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space
 *
 * The transfer characteristic, or opto-electrical transfer function (OETF),
 * is the way a color is converted from mathematically linear space into a
 * non-linear output signals.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec._709#Transfer_characteristics
 *
 * The matrix coefficients are used to convert between YCbCr and RGB colors.

/**
 * Pixel format.
 *
 * SDL's pixel formats have the following naming convention:
 *
 * - Names with a list of components and a single bit count, such as RGB24 and
 *   ABGR32, define a platform-independent encoding into bytes in the order
 *   specified. For example, in RGB24 data, each pixel is encoded in 3 bytes
 *   (red, green, blue) in that order, and in ABGR32 data, each pixel is
 *   encoded in 4 bytes alpha, blue, green, red) in that order. Use these
 *   names if the property of a format that is important to you is the order
 *   of the bytes in memory or on disk.
 * - Names with a bit count per component, such as ARGB8888 and XRGB1555, are
 *   "packed" into an appropriately-sized integer in the platform's native
 *   endianness. For example, ARGB8888 is a sequence of 32-bit integers; in
 *   each integer, the most significant bits are alpha, and the least
 *   significant bits are blue. On a little-endian CPU such as x86, the least
 *   significant bits of each integer are arranged first in memory, but on a
 *   big-endian CPU such as s390x, the most significant bits are arranged
 *   first. Use these names if the property of a format that is important to
 *   you is the meaning of each bit position within a native-endianness
 *   integer.
 * - In indexed formats such as INDEX4LSB, each pixel is represented by
 *   encoding an index into the palette into the indicated number of bits,
 *   with multiple pixels packed into each byte if appropriate. In LSB
 *   formats, the first (leftmost) pixel is stored in the least-significant
 *   bits of the byte; in MSB formats, it's stored in the most-significant
 *   bits. INDEX8 does not need LSB/MSB variants, because each pixel exactly
 *   fills one byte.
 *
 * The 32-bit byte-array encodings such as RGBA32 are aliases for the
 * appropriate 8888 encoding for the current platform. For example, RGBA32 is
 * an alias for ABGR8888 on little-endian CPUs like x86, or an alias for
 * RGBA8888 on big-endian CPUs.

 * - `prop::appMetaData.COPYRIGHT_STRING`: The human-readable copyright

   * The `mode` string is treated roughly the same as in a call to the C
   * library's fopen(), even if SDL doesn't happen to use fopen() behind the
   * scenes.
   *
   * Available `mode` strings:
   *
   * - "r": Open a file for reading. The file must exist.
   * - "w": Create an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name
   *   already exists its content is erased and the file is treated as a new
   *   empty file.
   * - "a": Append to a file. Writing operations append data at the end of the
   *   file. The file is created if it does not exist.
   * - "r+": Open a file for update both reading and writing. The file must
   *   exist.
   * - "w+": Create an empty file for both reading and writing. If a file with
   *   the same name already exists its content is erased and the file is
   *   treated as a new empty file.
   * - "a+": Open a file for reading and appending. All writing operations are
   *   performed at the end of the file, protecting the previous content to be
   *   overwritten. You can reposition (fseek, rewind) the internal pointer to
   *   anywhere in the file for reading, but writing operations will move it
   *   back to the end of file. The file is created if it does not exist.
   *
   * **NOTE**: In order to open a file as a binary file, a "b" character has to
   * be included in the `mode` string. This additional "b" character can either
   * be appended at the end of the string (thus making the following compound
   * modes: "rb", "wb", "ab", "r+b", "w+b", "a+b") or be inserted between the
   * letter and the "+" sign for the mixed modes ("rb+", "wb+", "ab+").
   * Additional characters may follow the sequence, although they should have no
   * effect. For example, "t" is sometimes appended to make explicit the file is
   * a text file.
   *
   * This function supports Unicode filenames, but they must be encoded in UTF-8
   * format, regardless of the underlying operating system.
   *
   * In Android, IOStreamRef.IOStreamRef() can be used to open content://
   * URIs. As a fallback, IOStreamRef.IOStreamRef() will transparently open a
   * matching filename in the app's `assets`.
   *
   * Closing the IOStreamRef will close SDL's internal file handle.
   *
   * The following properties may be set at creation time by SDL:
   *
   * - `prop::IOStream.WINDOWS_HANDLE_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast
   *   to a win32 `HANDLE`, that this IOStreamRef is using to access the
   *   filesystem. If the program isn't running on Windows, or SDL used some
   *   other method to access the filesystem, this property will not be set.
   * - `prop::IOStream.STDIO_FILE_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast to a
   *   stdio `FILE *`, that this IOStreamRef is using to access the filesystem.
   *   If SDL used some other method to access the filesystem, this property
   *   will not be set. PLEASE NOTE that if SDL is using a different C runtime
   *   than your app, trying to use this pointer will almost certainly result in
   *   a crash! This is mostly a problem on Windows; make sure you build SDL and
   *   your app with the same compiler and settings to avoid it.
   * - `prop::IOStream.FILE_DESCRIPTOR_NUMBER`: a file descriptor that this
   *   IOStreamRef is using to access the filesystem.
   * - `prop::IOStream.ANDROID_AASSET_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast
   *   to an Android NDK `AAsset *`, that this IOStreamRef is using to access
   *   the filesystem. If SDL used some other method to access the filesystem,
   *   this property will not be set.
   *

/**
 *
 * @defgroup CategoryStorage Storage Abstraction
 *
 * The storage API is a high-level API designed to abstract away the
 * portability issues that come up when using something lower-level (in SDL's
 * case, this sits on top of the [Filesystem](CategoryFilesystem) and
 * [IOStream](CategoryIOStream) subsystems). It is significantly more
 * restrictive than a typical filesystem API, for a number of reasons:
 *
 * 1. **What to Access:** A common pitfall with existing filesystem APIs is
 * the assumption that all storage is monolithic. However, many other
 * platforms (game consoles in particular) are more strict about what _type_
 * of filesystem is being accessed; for example, game content and user data
 * are usually two separate storage devices with entirely different
 * characteristics (and possibly different low-level APIs altogether!).
 *
 * 2. **How to Access:** Another common mistake is applications assuming that
 * all storage is universally writeable - again, many platforms treat game
 * content and user data as two separate storage devices, and only user data
 * is writeable while game content is read-only.
 *
 * 3. **When to Access:** The most common portability issue with filesystem
 * access is _timing_ - you cannot always assume that the storage device is
 * always accessible all of the time, nor can you assume that there are no
 * limits to how long you have access to a particular device.
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * ```c
 * void ReadGameData(void)
 * {
 *     extern char** fileNames;
 *     extern size_t numFiles;
 *     for (size_t i = 0; i < numFiles; i += 1) {
 *         FILE *data = fopen(fileNames[i], "rwb");
 *         if (data == nullptr) {
 *             // Something bad happened!
 *         } else {
 *             // A bunch of stuff happens here
 *             fclose(data);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * void ReadSave(void)
 * {
 *     FILE *save = fopen("saves/save0.sav", "rb");
 *     if (save == nullptr) {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     } else {
 *         // A bunch of stuff happens here
 *         fclose(save);
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * void WriteSave(void)
 * {
 *     FILE *save = fopen("saves/save0.sav", "wb");
 *     if (save == nullptr) {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     } else {
 *         // A bunch of stuff happens here
 *         fclose(save);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Going over the bullet points again:
 *
 * 1. **What to Access:** This code accesses a global filesystem; game data
 * and saves are all presumed to be in the current working directory (which
 * may or may not be the game's installation folder!).
 *
 * 2. **How to Access:** This code assumes that content paths are writeable,
 * and that save data is also writeable despite being in the same location as
 * the game data.
 *
 * 3. **When to Access:** This code assumes that they can be called at any
 * time, since the filesystem is always accessible and has no limits on how
 * long the filesystem is being accessed.
 *
 * Due to these assumptions, the filesystem code is not portable and will fail
 * under these common scenarios:
 *
 * - The game is installed on a device that is read-only, both content loading
 *   and game saves will fail or crash outright
 * - Game/User storage is not implicitly mounted, so no files will be found
 *   for either scenario when a platform requires explicitly mounting
 *   filesystems
 * - Save data may not be safe since the I/O is not being flushed or
 *   validated, so an error occurring elsewhere in the program may result in
 *   missing/corrupted save data
 *
 * When using Storage, these types of problems are virtually impossible to
 * trip over:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * void ReadGameData(void)
 * {
 *     extern char** fileNames;
 *     extern size_t numFiles;
 *
 *     Storage title(nullptr, 0);
 *     if (title == nullptr) {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     }
 *     while (!title.Ready()) {
 *         Delay(1);
 *     }
 *
 *     for (size_t i = 0; i < numFiles; i += 1) {
 *         void* dst;
 *         Uint64 dstLen = title.GetSize(fileNames[i]);
 *
 *         if (dstLen > 0) {
 *           dst = malloc(dstLen);
 *           if (title.ReadFile(fileNames[i], dst, dstLen)) {
 *                 // A bunch of stuff happens here
 *             } else {
 *                 // Something bad happened!
 *             }
 *             free(dst);
 *         } else {
 *             // Something bad happened!
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * void ReadSave(void)
 * {
 *     Storage user("libsdl", "Storage Example", 0);
 *     if (user == nullptr) {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     }
 *     while (!user.Ready()) {
 *         Delay(1);
 *     }
 *
 *     Uint64 saveLen = user.GetFileSize();
 *     if (saveLen > 0) {
 *         void* dst = malloc(saveLen);
 *         if (user.ReadFile("save0.sav", dst, saveLen)) {
 *             // A bunch of stuff happens here
 *         } else {
 *             // Something bad happened!
 *         }
 *         free(dst);
 *     } else {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * void WriteSave(void)
 * {
 *     Storage user("libsdl", "Storage Example", 0);
 *     if (user == nullptr) {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     }
 *     while (!user.Ready()) {
 *         Delay(1);
 *     }
 *
 *     extern void *saveData; // A bunch of stuff happened here...
 *     extern Uint64 saveLen;
 *     if (!user.WriteFile("save0.sav", saveData, saveLen)) {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note the improvements that Storage makes:
 *
 * 1. **What to Access:** This code explicitly reads from a title or user
 * storage device based on the context of the function.
 *
 * 2. **How to Access:** This code explicitly uses either a read or write
 * function based on the context of the function.
 *
 * 3. **When to Access:** This code explicitly opens the device when it needs
 * to, and closes it when it is finished working with the filesystem.
 *
 * The result is an application that is significantly more robust against the
 * increasing demands of platforms and their filesystems!
 *
 * A publicly available example of an Storage backend is the
 * [Steam Cloud](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloud)
 * backend - you can initialize Steamworks when starting the program, and then
 * SDL will recognize that Steamworks is initialized and automatically use
 * ISteamRemoteStorage when the application opens user storage. More
 * importantly, when you _open_ storage it knows to begin a "batch" of
 * filesystem operations, and when you _close_ storage it knows to end and
 * flush the batch. This is used by Steam to support
 * [Dynamic Cloud
 * Sync](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3142949576401813670)
 * ; users can save data on one PC, put the device to sleep, and then continue
 * playing on another PC (and vice versa) with the save data fully
 * synchronized across all devices, allowing for a seamless experience without
 * having to do full restarts of the program.
 *
 * ## Notes on valid paths
 *
 * All paths in the Storage API use Unix-style path separators ('/'). Using a
 * different path separator will not work, even if the underlying platform
 * would otherwise accept it. This is to keep code using the Storage API
 * portable between platforms and Storage implementations and simplify app
 * code.
 *
 * Paths with relative directories ("." and "..") are forbidden by the Storage
 * API.
 *
 * All valid UTF-8 strings (discounting the nullptr terminator character and the
 * '/' path separator) are usable for filenames, however, an underlying
 * Storage implementation may not support particularly strange sequences and
 * refuse to create files with those names, etc.

   * SDL makes an attempt to report `prop::thread.CREATE_NAME_STRING` to the

   * null-terminated UTF-8, but these guidelines are helpful in choosing a name:
   *
   * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/149932/naming-conventions-for-threads
   *
   * If a system imposes requirements, SDL will try to munge the string for it
   * (truncate, etc), but the original string contents will be available from
   * ThreadRef.GetName().
   *
   * The size (in bytes) of the new stack can be specified with
   * `prop::thread.CREATE_STACKSIZE_NUMBER`. Zero means "use the system
   * default" which might be wildly different between platforms. x86 Linux
   * generally defaults to eight megabytes, an embedded device might be a few
   * kilobytes instead. You generally need to specify a stack that is a multiple
   * of the system's page size (in many cases, this is 4 kilobytes, but check
   * your system documentation).
   *
   * Note that this "function" is actually a macro that calls an internal
   * function with two extra parameters not listed here; they are hidden through
   * preprocessor macros and are needed to support various C runtimes at the
   * point of the function call. Language bindings that aren't using the C
   * headers will need to deal with this.
   *

/**
 *
 * @defgroup CategoryAudio Audio Playback, Recording, and Mixing
 *
 * Audio functionality for the SDL library.
 *
 * All audio in SDL3 revolves around AudioStream. Whether you want to play
 * or record audio, convert it, stream it, buffer it, or mix it, you're going
 * to be passing it through an audio stream.
 *
 * Audio streams are quite flexible; they can accept any amount of data at a
 * time, in any supported format, and output it as needed in any other format,
 * even if the data format changes on either side halfway through.
 *
 * An app opens an audio device and binds any number of audio streams to it,
 * feeding more data to the streams as available. When the device needs more
 * data, it will pull it from all bound streams and mix them together for
 * playback.
 *
 * Audio streams can also use an app-provided callback to supply data
 * on-demand, which maps pretty closely to the SDL2 audio model.
 *
 * SDL also provides a simple .WAV loader in LoadWAV (and LoadWAV
 * if you aren't reading from a file) as a basic means to load sound data into
 * your program.
 *
 * ## Logical audio devices
 *
 * In SDL3, opening a physical device (like a SoundBlaster 16 Pro) gives you a
 * logical device ID that you can bind audio streams to. In almost all cases,
 * logical devices can be used anywhere in the API that a physical device is
 * normally used. However, since each device opening generates a new logical
 * device, different parts of the program (say, a VoIP library, or
 * text-to-speech framework, or maybe some other sort of mixer on top of SDL)
 * can have their own device opens that do not interfere with each other; each
 * logical device will mix its separate audio down to a single buffer, fed to
 * the physical device, behind the scenes. As many logical devices as you like
 * can come and go; SDL will only have to open the physical device at the OS
 * level once, and will manage all the logical devices on top of it
 * internally.
 *
 * One other benefit of logical devices: if you don't open a specific physical
 * device, instead opting for the default, SDL can automatically migrate those
 * logical devices to different hardware as circumstances change: a user
 * plugged in headphones? The system default changed? SDL can transparently
 * migrate the logical devices to the correct physical device seamlessly and
 * keep playing; the app doesn't even have to know it happened if it doesn't
 * want to.
 *
 * ## Simplified audio
 *
 * As a simplified model for when a single source of audio is all that's
 * needed, an app can use AudioStream.AudioStream, which is a single
 * function to open an audio device, create an audio stream, bind that stream
 * to the newly-opened device, and (optionally) provide a callback for
 * obtaining audio data. When using this function, the primary interface is
 * the AudioStream and the device handle is mostly hidden away; destroying
 * a stream created through this function will also close the device, stream
 * bindings cannot be changed, etc. One other quirk of this is that the device
 * is started in a _paused_ state and must be explicitly resumed; this is
 * partially to offer a clean migration for SDL2 apps and partially because
 * the app might have to do more setup before playback begins; in the
 * non-simplified form, nothing will play until a stream is bound to a device,
 * so they start _unpaused_.
 *
 * ## Channel layouts
 *
 * Audio data passing through SDL is uncompressed PCM data, interleaved. One
 * can provide their own decompression through an MP3, etc, decoder, but SDL
 * does not provide this directly. Each interleaved channel of data is meant
 * to be in a specific order.
 *
 * Abbreviations:
 *
 * - FRONT = single mono speaker
 * - FL = front left speaker
 * - FR = front right speaker
 * - FC = front center speaker
 * - BL = back left speaker
 * - BR = back right speaker
 * - SR = surround right speaker
 * - SL = surround left speaker
 * - BC = back center speaker
 * - LFE = low-frequency speaker
 *
 * These are listed in the order they are laid out in memory, so "FL, FR"
 * means "the front left speaker is laid out in memory first, then the front
 * right, then it repeats for the next audio frame".
 *
 * - 1 channel (mono) layout: FRONT
 * - 2 channels (stereo) layout: FL, FR
 * - 3 channels (2.1) layout: FL, FR, LFE
 * - 4 channels (quad) layout: FL, FR, BL, BR
 * - 5 channels (4.1) layout: FL, FR, LFE, BL, BR
 * - 6 channels (5.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR (last two can also be
 *   SL, SR)
 * - 7 channels (6.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BC, SL, SR
 * - 8 channels (7.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR, SL, SR
 *
 * This is the same order as DirectSound expects, but applied to all
 * platforms; SDL will swizzle the channels as necessary if a platform expects
 * something different.
 *
 * AudioStream can also be provided channel maps to change this ordering
 * to whatever is necessary, in other audio processing scenarios.

/**
 * Load the audio data of a WAVE file into memory.
 *
 * Loading a WAVE file requires `src`, `spec`, `audio_buf` and `audio_len` to
 * be valid pointers. The entire data portion of the file is then loaded into
 * memory and decoded if necessary.
 *
 * Supported formats are RIFF WAVE files with the formats PCM (8, 16, 24, and
 * 32 bits), IEEE Float (32 bits), Microsoft ADPCM and IMA ADPCM (4 bits), and
 * A-law and mu-law (8 bits). Other formats are currently unsupported and
 * cause an error.
 *
 * If this function succeeds, the return value is zero and the pointer to the
 * audio data allocated by the function is written to `audio_buf` and its
 * length in bytes to `audio_len`. The AudioSpec members `freq`,
 * `channels`, and `format` are set to the values of the audio data in the
 * buffer.
 *
 * It's necessary to use free() to free the audio data returned in
 * `audio_buf` when it is no longer used.
 *
 * Because of the underspecification of the .WAV format, there are many
 * problematic files in the wild that cause issues with strict decoders. To
 * provide compatibility with these files, this decoder is lenient in regards
 * to the truncation of the file, the fact chunk, and the size of the RIFF
 * chunk. The hints `SDL_HINT_WAVE_RIFF_CHUNK_SIZE`,
 * `SDL_HINT_WAVE_TRUNCATION`, and `SDL_HINT_WAVE_FACT_CHUNK` can be used to
 * tune the behavior of the loading process.
 *
 * Any file that is invalid (due to truncation, corruption, or wrong values in
 * the headers), too big, or unsupported causes an error. Additionally, any
 * critical I/O error from the data source will terminate the loading process
 * with an error. The function returns nullptr on error and in all cases (with
 * the exception of `src` being nullptr), an appropriate error message will be
 * set.
 *
 * It is required that the data source supports seeking.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```c
 * LoadWAV(IOStreamRef.IOStreamRef("sample.wav", "rb"), true, &spec, &buf,
 * &len);
 * ```
 *
 * Note that the LoadWAV function does this same thing for you, but in a
 * less messy way:
 *
 * ```c
 * LoadWAV("sample.wav", &spec, &buf, &len);
 * ```
 *
 * @param src the data source for the WAVE data.
 * @param spec a pointer to an AudioSpec that will be set to the WAVE
 *             data's format details on successful return.

/**
 * @defgroup CategoryVideo Display and Window Management
 *
 * SDL's video subsystem is largely interested in abstracting window
 * management from the underlying operating system. You can create windows,
 * manage them in various ways, set them fullscreen, and get events when
 * interesting things happen with them, such as the mouse or keyboard
 * interacting with a window.
 *
 * The video subsystem is also interested in abstracting away some
 * platform-specific differences in OpenGL: context creation, swapping
 * buffers, etc. This may be crucial to your app, but also you are not
 * required to use OpenGL at all. In fact, SDL can provide rendering to those
 * windows as well, either with an easy-to-use
 * [2D API](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryRender)
 * or with a more-powerful
 * [GPU API](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryGPU)
 * . Of course, it can simply get out of your way and give you the window
 * handles you need to use Vulkan, Direct3D, Metal, or whatever else you like
 * directly, too.
 *
 * The video subsystem covers a lot of functionality, out of necessity, so it
 * is worth perusing the list of functions just to see what's available, but
 * most apps can get by with simply creating a window and listening for
 * events, so start with SDL_CreateWindow() and SDL_PollEvent().

   * - `WINDOW_RESIZABLE`: window can be resized
   * - `WINDOW_MINIMIZED`: window is minimized
   * - `WINDOW_MAXIMIZED`: window is maximized
   * - `WINDOW_MOUSE_GRABBED`: window has grabbed mouse focus
   * - `WINDOW_INPUT_FOCUS`: window has input focus
   * - `WINDOW_MOUSE_FOCUS`: window has mouse focus
   * - `WINDOW_EXTERNAL`: window not created by SDL
   * - `WINDOW_MODAL`: window is modal
   * - `WINDOW_HIGH_PIXEL_DENSITY`: window uses high pixel density back
   *   buffer if possible
   * - `WINDOW_MOUSE_CAPTURE`: window has mouse captured (unrelated to
   *   MOUSE_GRABBED)
   * - `WINDOW_ALWAYS_ON_TOP`: window should always be above others
   * - `WINDOW_UTILITY`: window should be treated as a utility window, not
   *   showing in the task bar and window list
   * - `WINDOW_TOOLTIP`: window should be treated as a tooltip and does not
   *   get mouse or keyboard focus, requires a parent window
   * - `WINDOW_POPUP_MENU`: window should be treated as a popup menu,
   *   requires a parent window
   * - `WINDOW_KEYBOARD_GRABBED`: window has grabbed keyboard input
   * - `WINDOW_VULKAN`: window usable with a Vulkan instance
   * - `WINDOW_METAL`: window usable with a Metal instance
   * - `WINDOW_TRANSPARENT`: window with transparent buffer
   * - `WINDOW_NOT_FOCUSABLE`: window should not be focusable
   *
   * The WindowRef is implicitly shown if WINDOW_HIDDEN is not set.
   *
   * On Apple's macOS, you **must** set the NSHighResolutionCapable Info.plist
   * property to YES, otherwise you will not receive a High-DPI OpenGL canvas.
   *
   * The window pixel size may differ from its window coordinate size if the
   * window is on a high pixel density display. Use WindowRef.GetSize() to
   * query the client area's size in window coordinates, and
   * WindowRef.GetSizeInPixels() or RendererRef.GetOutputSize() to query the
   * drawable size in pixels. Note that the drawable size can vary after the
   * window is created and should be queried again if you get an
   * EVENT_WINDOW_PIXEL_SIZE_CHANGED event.
   *
   * If the window is created with any of the WINDOW_OPENGL or

 * Get an OpenGL function by name.

 * If the GL library is loaded at runtime with GL_LoadLibrary(), then all

 * function pointers to OpenGL extensions.
 *
 * There are some quirks to looking up OpenGL functions that require some
 * extra care from the application. If you code carefully, you can handle
 * these quirks without any platform-specific code, though:
 *
 * - On Windows, function pointers are specific to the current GL context;
 *   this means you need to have created a GL context and made it current
 *   before calling GL_GetProcAddress(). If you recreate your context or
 *   create a second context, you should assume that any existing function
 *   pointers aren't valid to use with it. This is (currently) a
 *   Windows-specific limitation, and in practice lots of drivers don't suffer
 *   this limitation, but it is still the way the wgl API is documented to
 *   work and you should expect crashes if you don't respect it. Store a copy
 *   of the function pointers that comes and goes with context lifespan.
 * - On X11, function pointers returned by this function are valid for any
 *   context, and can even be looked up before a context is created at all.
 *   This means that, for at least some common OpenGL implementations, if you
 *   look up a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-nullptr result that
 *   is _NOT_ safe to call. You must always make sure the function is actually
 *   available for a given GL context before calling it, by checking for the
 *   existence of the appropriate extension with GL_ExtensionSupported(),
 *   or verifying that the version of OpenGL you're using offers the function
 *   as core functionality.
 * - Some OpenGL drivers, on all platforms, *will* return nullptr if a function
 *   isn't supported, but you can't count on this behavior. Check for
 *   extensions you use, and if you get a nullptr anyway, act as if that
 *   extension wasn't available. This is probably a bug in the driver, but you
 *   can code defensively for this scenario anyhow.
 * - Just because you're on Linux/Unix, don't assume you'll be using X11.
 *   Next-gen display servers are waiting to replace it, and may or may not
 *   make the same promises about function pointers.
 * - OpenGL function pointers must be declared `APIENTRY` as in the example
 *   code. This will ensure the proper calling convention is followed on
 *   platforms where this matters (Win32) thereby avoiding stack corruption.

 * Event queue management.
 *
 * It's extremely common--often required--that an app deal with SDL's event
 * queue. Almost all useful information about interactions with the real world
 * flow through here: the user interacting with the computer and app, hardware
 * coming and going, the system changing in some way, etc.
 *
 * An app generally takes a moment, perhaps at the start of a new frame, to
 * examine any events that have occurred since the last time and process or
 * ignore them. This is generally done by calling SDL_PollEvent() in a loop
 * until it returns false (or, if using the main callbacks, events are
 * provided one at a time in calls to SDL_AppEvent() before the next call to
 * SDL_AppIterate(); in this scenario, the app does not call PollEvent()
 * at all).
 *
 * There is other forms of control, too: PeepEvents() has more
 * functionality at the cost of more complexity, and WaitEvent() can block
 * the process until something interesting happens, which might be beneficial
 * for certain types of programs on low-power hardware. One may also call
 * AddEventWatch() to set a callback when new events arrive.
 *
 * The app is free to generate their own events, too: PushEvent() allows the
 * app to put events onto the queue for later retrieval; RegisterEvents()
 * can guarantee that these events have a type that isn't in use by other
 * parts of the system.

/**
 *
 * @defgroup CategoryMouse Mouse Support
 *
 * Any GUI application has to deal with the mouse, and SDL provides functions
 * to manage mouse input and the displayed cursor.
 *
 * Most interactions with the mouse will come through the event subsystem.
 * Moving a mouse generates an EVENT_MOUSE_MOTION event, pushing a button
 * generates EVENT_MOUSE_BUTTON_DOWN, etc, but one can also query the
 * current state of the mouse at any time with GetMouseState().
 *
 * For certain games, it's useful to disassociate the mouse cursor from mouse
 * input. An FPS, for example, would not want the player's motion to stop as
 * the mouse hits the edge of the window. For these scenarios, use
 * WindowRef.SetRelativeMouseMode(), which hides the cursor, grabs mouse input
 * to the window, and reads mouse input no matter how far it moves.
 *
 * Games that want the system to track the mouse but want to draw their own
 * cursor can use HideCursor() and ShowCursor(). It might be more
 * efficient to let the system manage the cursor, if possible, using
 * SetCursor() with a custom image made through CursorRef.CursorRef(),
 * or perhaps just a specific system cursor from CursorRef.CursorRef().
 *
 * SDL can, on many platforms, differentiate between multiple connected mice,
 * allowing for interesting input scenarios and multiplayer games. They can be
 * enumerated with GetMice(), and SDL will send EVENT_MOUSE_ADDED and
 * EVENT_MOUSE_REMOVED events as they are connected and unplugged.
 *
 * Since many apps only care about basic mouse input, SDL offers a virtual
 * mouse device for touch and pen input, which often can make a desktop
 * application work on a touchscreen phone without any code changes. Apps that
 * care about touch/pen separately from mouse input should filter out events
 * with a `which` field of SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID/SDL_PEN_MOUSEID.
