 * Thread Management
 *
 * This is provided for compatibility and completeness, we advise you to use
 * std's thread facilities.
 *
 * SDL offers cross-platform thread management functions. These are mostly
 * concerned with starting threads, setting their priority, and dealing with
 * their termination.
 *
 * In addition, there is support for Thread Local Storage (data that is unique
 * to each thread, but accessed from a single key).
 *
 * On platforms without thread support (such as Emscripten when built without
 * pthreads), these functions still exist, but things like
 * ThreadBase.ThreadBase() will report failure without doing anything.
 *
 * If you're going to work with threads, you almost certainly need to have a
 * good understanding of [CategoryMutex](CategoryMutex) as well.

   *   Required.
   * - `prop::thread.CREATE_NAME_STRING`: the name of the new thread, which
   *   might be available to debuggers. Optional, defaults to nullptr.
   * - `prop::thread.CREATE_USERDATA_POINTER`: an arbitrary app-defined
   *   pointer, which is passed to the entry function on the new thread, as its
   *   only parameter. Optional, defaults to nullptr.
   * - `prop::thread.CREATE_STACKSIZE_NUMBER`: the size, in bytes, of the new
   *   thread's stack. Optional, defaults to 0 (system-defined default).
   *
   * SDL makes an attempt to report `prop::thread.CREATE_NAME_STRING` to the
   * system, so that debuggers can display it. Not all platforms support this.
   *
   * Thread naming is a little complicated: Most systems have very small limits
   * for the string length (Haiku has 32 bytes, Linux currently has 16, Visual
   * C++ 6.0 has _nine_!), and possibly other arbitrary rules. You'll have to
   * see what happens with your system's debugger. The name should be UTF-8 (but
   * using the naming limits of C identifiers is a better bet). There are no
   * requirements for thread naming conventions, so long as the string is
   * null-terminated UTF-8, but these guidelines are helpful in choosing a name:
   *
   * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/149932/naming-conventions-for-threads
   *
   * If a system imposes requirements, SDL will try to munge the string for it
   * (truncate, etc), but the original string contents will be available from
   * ThreadBase.GetName().
   *
   * The size (in bytes) of the new stack can be specified with
   * `prop::thread.CREATE_STACKSIZE_NUMBER`. Zero means "use the system
   * default" which might be wildly different between platforms. x86 Linux
   * generally defaults to eight megabytes, an embedded device might be a few
   * kilobytes instead. You generally need to specify a stack that is a multiple
   * of the system's page size (in many cases, this is 4 kilobytes, but check
   * your system documentation).
   *
   * Note that this "function" is actually a macro that calls an internal
   * function with two extra parameters not listed here; they are hidden through
   * preprocessor macros and are needed to support various C runtimes at the
   * point of the function call. Language bindings that aren't using the C
   * headers will need to deal with this.
   *
   * The actual symbol in SDL is `SDL_CreateThreadWithPropertiesRuntime`, so
   * there is no symbol clash, but trying to load an SDL shared library and look
