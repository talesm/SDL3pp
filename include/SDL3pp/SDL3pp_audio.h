/**
 * @defgroup CategoryAudio Audio Playback, Recording, and Mixing
 *
 * Audio functionality for the SDL library.
 *
 * All audio in SDL3 revolves around AudioStream. Whether you want to play
 * or record audio, convert it, stream it, buffer it, or mix it, you're going
 * to be passing it through an audio stream.
 *
 * Audio streams are quite flexible; they can accept any amount of data at a
 * time, in any supported format, and output it as needed in any other format,
 * even if the data format changes on either side halfway through.
 *
 * An app opens an audio device and binds any number of audio streams to it,
 * feeding more data to the streams as available. When the device needs more
 * data, it will pull it from all bound streams and mix them together for
 * playback.
 *
 * Audio streams can also use an app-provided callback to supply data
 * on-demand, which maps pretty closely to the SDL2 audio model.
 *
 * SDL also provides a simple .WAV loader in LoadWAV (and LoadWAV
 * if you aren't reading from a file) as a basic means to load sound data into
 * your program.
 *
 * ## Logical audio devices
 *
 * In SDL3, opening a physical device (like a SoundBlaster 16 Pro) gives you a
 * logical device ID that you can bind audio streams to. In almost all cases,
 * logical devices can be used anywhere in the API that a physical device is
 * normally used. However, since each device opening generates a new logical
 * device, different parts of the program (say, a VoIP library, or
 * text-to-speech framework, or maybe some other sort of mixer on top of SDL)
 * can have their own device opens that do not interfere with each other; each
 * logical device will mix its separate audio down to a single buffer, fed to
 * the physical device, behind the scenes. As many logical devices as you like
 * can come and go; SDL will only have to open the physical device at the OS
 * level once, and will manage all the logical devices on top of it
 * internally.
 *
 * One other benefit of logical devices: if you don't open a specific physical
 * device, instead opting for the default, SDL can automatically migrate those
 * logical devices to different hardware as circumstances change: a user
 * plugged in headphones? The system default changed? SDL can transparently
 * migrate the logical devices to the correct physical device seamlessly and
 * keep playing; the app doesn't even have to know it happened if it doesn't
 * want to.
 *
 * ## Simplified audio
 *
 * As a simplified model for when a single source of audio is all that's
 * needed, an app can use AudioStream.AudioStream, which is a single
 * function to open an audio device, create an audio stream, bind that stream
 * to the newly-opened device, and (optionally) provide a callback for
 * obtaining audio data. When using this function, the primary interface is
 * the AudioStream and the device handle is mostly hidden away; destroying
 * a stream created through this function will also close the device, stream
 * bindings cannot be changed, etc. One other quirk of this is that the device
 * is started in a _paused_ state and must be explicitly resumed; this is
 * partially to offer a clean migration for SDL2 apps and partially because
 * the app might have to do more setup before playback begins; in the
 * non-simplified form, nothing will play until a stream is bound to a device,
 * so they start _unpaused_.
 *
 * ## Channel layouts
 *
 * Audio data passing through SDL is uncompressed PCM data, interleaved. One
 * can provide their own decompression through an MP3, etc, decoder, but SDL
 * does not provide this directly. Each interleaved channel of data is meant
 * to be in a specific order.
 *
 * Abbreviations:
 *
 * - FRONT = single mono speaker
 * - FL = front left speaker
 * - FR = front right speaker
 * - FC = front center speaker
 * - BL = back left speaker
 * - BR = back right speaker
 * - SR = surround right speaker
 * - SL = surround left speaker
 * - BC = back center speaker
 * - LFE = low-frequency speaker
 *
 * These are listed in the order they are laid out in memory, so "FL, FR"
 * means "the front left speaker is laid out in memory first, then the front
 * right, then it repeats for the next audio frame".
 *
 * - 1 channel (mono) layout: FRONT
 * - 2 channels (stereo) layout: FL, FR
 * - 3 channels (2.1) layout: FL, FR, LFE
 * - 4 channels (quad) layout: FL, FR, BL, BR
 * - 5 channels (4.1) layout: FL, FR, LFE, BL, BR
 * - 6 channels (5.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR (last two can also be
 *   SL, SR)
 * - 7 channels (6.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BC, SL, SR
 * - 8 channels (7.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR, SL, SR
 *
 * This is the same order as DirectSound expects, but applied to all
 * platforms; SDL will swizzle the channels as necessary if a platform expects
 * something different.
 *
 * AudioStream can also be provided channel maps to change this ordering
 * to whatever is necessary, in other audio processing scenarios.

   * Open a specific audio device.
   *
   * You can open both playback and recording devices through this function.
   * Playback devices will take data from bound audio streams, mix it, and send
   * it to the hardware. Recording devices will feed any bound audio streams
   * with a copy of any incoming data.
   *
   * An opened audio device starts out with no audio streams bound. To start
   * audio playing, bind a stream and supply audio data to it. Unlike SDL2,
   * there is no audio callback; you only bind audio streams and make sure they
   * have data flowing into them (however, you can simulate SDL2's semantics
   * fairly closely by using AudioStream.AudioStream instead of this
   * function).
   *
   * If you don't care about opening a specific device, pass a `devid` of either
   * `AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK` or
   * `AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_RECORDING`. In this case, SDL will try to pick
   * the most reasonable default, and may also switch between physical devices
   * seamlessly later, if the most reasonable default changes during the
   * lifetime of this opened device (user changed the default in the OS's system
   * preferences, the default got unplugged so the system jumped to a new
   * default, the user plugged in headphones on a mobile device, etc). Unless
   * you have a good reason to choose a specific device, this is probably what
   * you want.
   *
   * You may request a specific format for the audio device, but there is no
   * promise the device will honor that request for several reasons. As such,
   * it's only meant to be a hint as to what data your app will provide. Audio
   * streams will accept data in whatever format you specify and manage
   * conversion for you as appropriate. AudioDevice.GetFormat can tell you
   * the preferred format for the device before opening and the actual format
   * the device is using after opening.
   *
   * It's legal to open the same device ID more than once; each successful open
   * will generate a new logical AudioDevice that is managed separately
   * from others on the same physical device. This allows libraries to open a
   * device separately from the main app and bind its own streams without
   * conflicting.
   *
   * It is also legal to open a device ID returned by a previous call to this
   * function; doing so just creates another logical device on the same physical
   * device. This may be useful for making logical groupings of audio streams.
   *
   * This function returns the opened device ID on success. This is a new,
   * unique AudioDevice that represents a logical device.
   *
   * Some backends might offer arbitrary devices (for example, a networked audio
   * protocol that can connect to an arbitrary server). For these, as a change
   * from SDL2, you should open a default device ID and use an SDL hint to
   * specify the target if you care, or otherwise let the backend figure out a
   * reasonable default. Most backends don't offer anything like this, and often
   * this would be an end user setting an environment variable for their custom
   * need, and not something an application should specifically manage.

 * You can open both playback and recording devices through this function.
 * Playback devices will take data from bound audio streams, mix it, and send

 * with a copy of any incoming data.
 *
 * An opened audio device starts out with no audio streams bound. To start
 * audio playing, bind a stream and supply audio data to it. Unlike SDL2,
 * there is no audio callback; you only bind audio streams and make sure they
 * have data flowing into them (however, you can simulate SDL2's semantics
 * fairly closely by using AudioStream.AudioStream instead of this
 * function).
 *
 * If you don't care about opening a specific device, pass a `devid` of either
 * `AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK` or
 * `AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_RECORDING`. In this case, SDL will try to pick
 * the most reasonable default, and may also switch between physical devices
 * seamlessly later, if the most reasonable default changes during the
 * lifetime of this opened device (user changed the default in the OS's system
 * preferences, the default got unplugged so the system jumped to a new
 * default, the user plugged in headphones on a mobile device, etc). Unless
 * you have a good reason to choose a specific device, this is probably what
 * you want.
 *
 * You may request a specific format for the audio device, but there is no
 * promise the device will honor that request for several reasons. As such,
 * it's only meant to be a hint as to what data your app will provide. Audio
 * streams will accept data in whatever format you specify and manage
 * conversion for you as appropriate. AudioDevice.GetFormat can tell you
 * the preferred format for the device before opening and the actual format
 * the device is using after opening.
 *
 * It's legal to open the same device ID more than once; each successful open
 * will generate a new logical AudioDevice that is managed separately
 * from others on the same physical device. This allows libraries to open a
 * device separately from the main app and bind its own streams without
 * conflicting.
 *
 * It is also legal to open a device ID returned by a previous call to this
 * function; doing so just creates another logical device on the same physical
 * device. This may be useful for making logical groupings of audio streams.
 *
 * This function returns the opened device ID on success. This is a new,

 *
 * Some backends might offer arbitrary devices (for example, a networked audio
 * protocol that can connect to an arbitrary server). For these, as a change
 * from SDL2, you should open a default device ID and use an SDL hint to
 * specify the target if you care, or otherwise let the backend figure out a
 * reasonable default. Most backends don't offer anything like this, and often
 * this would be an end user setting an environment variable for their custom
 * need, and not something an application should specifically manage.

/**
 * Set a callback that fires when data is about to be fed to an audio device.
 *
 * This is useful for accessing the final mix, perhaps for writing a

 *
 * The buffer is the final mix of all bound audio streams on an opened device;
 * this callback will fire regularly for any device that is both opened and
 * unpaused. If there is no new data to mix, either because no streams are
 * bound to the device or all the streams are empty, this callback will still
 * fire with the entire buffer set to silence.
 *
 * This callback is allowed to make changes to the data; the contents of the
 * buffer after this call is what is ultimately passed along to the hardware.
 *
 * The callback is always provided the data in float format (values from -1.0f
 * to 1.0f), but the number of channels or sample rate may be different than
 * the format the app requested when opening the device; SDL might have had to
 * manage a conversion behind the scenes, or the playback might have jumped to
 * new physical hardware when a system default changed, etc. These details may
 * change between calls. Accordingly, the size of the buffer might change
 * between calls as well.
 *
 * This callback can run at any time, and from any thread; if you need to
 * serialize access to your app's data, you should provide and use a mutex or
 * other synchronization device.
 *
 * All of this to say: there are specific needs this callback can fulfill, but
 * it is not the simplest interface. Apps should generally provide audio in
 * their preferred format through an AudioStream and let SDL handle the
 * difference.
 *
 * This function is extremely time-sensitive; the callback should do the least
 * amount of work possible and return as quickly as it can. The longer the
 * callback runs, the higher the risk of audio dropouts or other problems.
 *
 * This function will block until the audio device is in between iterations,
 * so any existing callback that might be running will finish before this
 * function sets the new callback and returns.

 * Load the audio data of a WAVE file into memory.
 *
 * Loading a WAVE file requires `src`, `spec`, `audio_buf` and `audio_len` to
 * be valid pointers. The entire data portion of the file is then loaded into
 * memory and decoded if necessary.
 *
 * Supported formats are RIFF WAVE files with the formats PCM (8, 16, 24, and
 * 32 bits), IEEE Float (32 bits), Microsoft ADPCM and IMA ADPCM (4 bits), and
 * A-law and mu-law (8 bits). Other formats are currently unsupported and
 * cause an error.
 *
 * If this function succeeds, the return value is zero and the pointer to the
 * audio data allocated by the function is written to `audio_buf` and its
 * length in bytes to `audio_len`. The AudioSpec members `freq`,
 * `channels`, and `format` are set to the values of the audio data in the
 * buffer.
 *
 * It's necessary to use free() to free the audio data returned in
 * `audio_buf` when it is no longer used.
 *
 * Because of the underspecification of the .WAV format, there are many
 * problematic files in the wild that cause issues with strict decoders. To
 * provide compatibility with these files, this decoder is lenient in regards
 * to the truncation of the file, the fact chunk, and the size of the RIFF
 * chunk. The hints `SDL_HINT_WAVE_RIFF_CHUNK_SIZE`,
 * `SDL_HINT_WAVE_TRUNCATION`, and `SDL_HINT_WAVE_FACT_CHUNK` can be used to
 * tune the behavior of the loading process.
 *
 * Any file that is invalid (due to truncation, corruption, or wrong values in
 * the headers), too big, or unsupported causes an error. Additionally, any
 * critical I/O error from the data source will terminate the loading process
 * with an error. The function returns nullptr on error and in all cases (with
 * the exception of `src` being nullptr), an appropriate error message will be
 * set.
 *
 * It is required that the data source supports seeking.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * LoadWAV(IOStream.FromFile("sample.wav", "rb"), spec);
