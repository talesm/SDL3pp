/**
 *
 * @defgroup CategoryAudio Audio Playback, Recording, and Mixing
 *
 * Audio functionality for the SDL library.
 *
 * All audio in SDL3 revolves around AudioStream. Whether you want to play
 * or record audio, convert it, stream it, buffer it, or mix it, you're going
 * to be passing it through an audio stream.
 *
 * Audio streams are quite flexible; they can accept any amount of data at a
 * time, in any supported format, and output it as needed in any other format,
 * even if the data format changes on either side halfway through.
 *
 * An app opens an audio device and binds any number of audio streams to it,
 * feeding more data to the streams as available. When the device needs more
 * data, it will pull it from all bound streams and mix them together for
 * playback.
 *
 * Audio streams can also use an app-provided callback to supply data
 * on-demand, which maps pretty closely to the SDL2 audio model.
 *
 * SDL also provides a simple .WAV loader in LoadWAV (and LoadWAV
 * if you aren't reading from a file) as a basic means to load sound data into
 * your program.
 *
 * ## Logical audio devices
 *
 * In SDL3, opening a physical device (like a SoundBlaster 16 Pro) gives you a
 * logical device ID that you can bind audio streams to. In almost all cases,
 * logical devices can be used anywhere in the API that a physical device is
 * normally used. However, since each device opening generates a new logical
 * device, different parts of the program (say, a VoIP library, or
 * text-to-speech framework, or maybe some other sort of mixer on top of SDL)
 * can have their own device opens that do not interfere with each other; each
 * logical device will mix its separate audio down to a single buffer, fed to
 * the physical device, behind the scenes. As many logical devices as you like
 * can come and go; SDL will only have to open the physical device at the OS
 * level once, and will manage all the logical devices on top of it
 * internally.
 *
 * One other benefit of logical devices: if you don't open a specific physical
 * device, instead opting for the default, SDL can automatically migrate those
 * logical devices to different hardware as circumstances change: a user
 * plugged in headphones? The system default changed? SDL can transparently
 * migrate the logical devices to the correct physical device seamlessly and
 * keep playing; the app doesn't even have to know it happened if it doesn't
 * want to.
 *
 * ## Simplified audio
 *
 * As a simplified model for when a single source of audio is all that's
 * needed, an app can use AudioStream.AudioStream, which is a single
 * function to open an audio device, create an audio stream, bind that stream
 * to the newly-opened device, and (optionally) provide a callback for
 * obtaining audio data. When using this function, the primary interface is
 * the AudioStream and the device handle is mostly hidden away; destroying
 * a stream created through this function will also close the device, stream
 * bindings cannot be changed, etc. One other quirk of this is that the device
 * is started in a _paused_ state and must be explicitly resumed; this is
 * partially to offer a clean migration for SDL2 apps and partially because
 * the app might have to do more setup before playback begins; in the
 * non-simplified form, nothing will play until a stream is bound to a device,
 * so they start _unpaused_.
 *
 * ## Channel layouts
 *
 * Audio data passing through SDL is uncompressed PCM data, interleaved. One
 * can provide their own decompression through an MP3, etc, decoder, but SDL
 * does not provide this directly. Each interleaved channel of data is meant
 * to be in a specific order.
 *
 * Abbreviations:
 *
 * - FRONT = single mono speaker
 * - FL = front left speaker
 * - FR = front right speaker
 * - FC = front center speaker
 * - BL = back left speaker
 * - BR = back right speaker
 * - SR = surround right speaker
 * - SL = surround left speaker
 * - BC = back center speaker
 * - LFE = low-frequency speaker
 *
 * These are listed in the order they are laid out in memory, so "FL, FR"
 * means "the front left speaker is laid out in memory first, then the front
 * right, then it repeats for the next audio frame".
 *
 * - 1 channel (mono) layout: FRONT
 * - 2 channels (stereo) layout: FL, FR
 * - 3 channels (2.1) layout: FL, FR, LFE
 * - 4 channels (quad) layout: FL, FR, BL, BR
 * - 5 channels (4.1) layout: FL, FR, LFE, BL, BR
 * - 6 channels (5.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR (last two can also be
 *   SL, SR)
 * - 7 channels (6.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BC, SL, SR
 * - 8 channels (7.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR, SL, SR
 *
 * This is the same order as DirectSound expects, but applied to all
 * platforms; SDL will swizzle the channels as necessary if a platform expects
 * something different.
 *
 * AudioStream can also be provided channel maps to change this ordering
 * to whatever is necessary, in other audio processing scenarios.

   * Unlike other methods of setup, the audio device will be closed when this

   *
   * Also unlike other functions, the audio device begins paused. This is to map
   * more closely to SDL2-style behavior, since there is no extra step here to

   * probably _should_), use AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK for playback and
   * AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_RECORDING for recording.
   *
   * One can optionally provide a callback function; if nullptr, the app is
   * expected to queue audio data for playback (or unqueue audio data if
   * capturing). Otherwise, the callback will begin to fire once the device is

   * Convenience function for straightforward audio init for the common case.
   *
   * If all your app intends to do is provide a single source of PCM audio, this
   * function allows you to do all your audio setup in a single call.
   *
   * This is also intended to be a clean means to migrate apps from SDL2.
   *
   * This function will open an audio device, create a stream and bind it.
   * Unlike other methods of setup, the audio device will be closed when this
   * stream is destroyed, so the app can treat the returned AudioStreamRef as
   * the only object needed to manage audio playback.
   *
   * Also unlike other functions, the audio device begins paused. This is to map
   * more closely to SDL2-style behavior, since there is no extra step here to
   * bind a stream to begin audio flowing. The audio device should be resumed
   * with `AudioStreamRef.ResumeDevice(stream);`
   *
   * This function works with both playback and recording devices.
   *
   * The `spec` parameter represents the app's side of the audio stream. That
   * is, for recording audio, this will be the output format, and for playing
   * audio, this will be the input format. If spec is nullptr, the system will
   * choose the format, and the app can use AudioStreamRef.GetFormat() to
   * obtain this information later.
   *
   * If you don't care about opening a specific audio device, you can (and
   * probably _should_), use AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK for playback and
   * AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_RECORDING for recording.
   *
   * One can optionally provide a callback function; if nullptr, the app is
   * expected to queue audio data for playback (or unqueue audio data if
   * capturing). Otherwise, the callback will begin to fire once the device is
   * unpaused.
   *
   * Destroying the returned stream with AudioStreamRef,Destroy() will also
   * close the audio device associated with this stream.
   *
   * @param devid an audio device to open, or AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK
   *              or AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_RECORDING.
   * @param spec the audio stream's data format. Can be std::nullopt.
   * @param callback a callback where the app will provide new data for
   *                 playback, or receive new data for recording. Can not be

/**
 * Load the audio data of a WAVE file into memory.
 *
 * Loading a WAVE file requires `src`, `spec`, `audio_buf` and `audio_len` to
 * be valid pointers. The entire data portion of the file is then loaded into
 * memory and decoded if necessary.
 *
 * Supported formats are RIFF WAVE files with the formats PCM (8, 16, 24, and
 * 32 bits), IEEE Float (32 bits), Microsoft ADPCM and IMA ADPCM (4 bits), and
 * A-law and mu-law (8 bits). Other formats are currently unsupported and
 * cause an error.
 *
 * If this function succeeds, the return value is zero and the pointer to the
 * audio data allocated by the function is written to `audio_buf` and its
 * length in bytes to `audio_len`. The AudioSpec members `freq`,
 * `channels`, and `format` are set to the values of the audio data in the
 * buffer.
 *
 * It's necessary to use free() to free the audio data returned in
 * `audio_buf` when it is no longer used.
 *
 * Because of the underspecification of the .WAV format, there are many
 * problematic files in the wild that cause issues with strict decoders. To
 * provide compatibility with these files, this decoder is lenient in regards
 * to the truncation of the file, the fact chunk, and the size of the RIFF
 * chunk. The hints `SDL_HINT_WAVE_RIFF_CHUNK_SIZE`,
 * `SDL_HINT_WAVE_TRUNCATION`, and `SDL_HINT_WAVE_FACT_CHUNK` can be used to
 * tune the behavior of the loading process.
 *
 * Any file that is invalid (due to truncation, corruption, or wrong values in
 * the headers), too big, or unsupported causes an error. Additionally, any
 * critical I/O error from the data source will terminate the loading process
 * with an error. The function returns nullptr on error and in all cases (with
 * the exception of `src` being nullptr), an appropriate error message will be
 * set.
 *
 * It is required that the data source supports seeking.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```c
 * LoadWAV(IOStreamRef.IOStreamRef("sample.wav", "rb"), true, &spec, &buf,
 * &len);
 * ```
 *
 * Note that the LoadWAV function does this same thing for you, but in a
 * less messy way:
 *
 * ```c
 * LoadWAV("sample.wav", &spec, &buf, &len);
 * ```
 *
 * @param src the data source for the WAVE data.
 * @param spec a pointer to an AudioSpec that will be set to the WAVE
 *             data's format details on successful return.
 * @returns the audio data on success or nullptr on failure.
 *
 * This function throws false if the .WAV file cannot be opened,
 * uses an unknown data format, or is corrupt,
 *
 * @threadsafety It is safe to call this function from any thread.
