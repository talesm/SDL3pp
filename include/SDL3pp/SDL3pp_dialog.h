 *
 * File dialog support.
 *
 * SDL offers file dialogs, to let users select files with native GUI
 * interfaces. There are "open" dialogs, "save" dialogs, and folder selection
 * dialogs. The app can control some details, such as filtering to specific
 * files, or whether multiple files can be selected by the user.
 *
 * Note that launching a file dialog is a non-blocking operation; control
 * returns to the app immediately, and a callback is called later (possibly in
 * another thread) when the user makes a choice.
 *
 * @{
 */

/**
 * An entry for filters for file dialogs.
 *
 * `name` is a user-readable label for the filter (for example, "Office
 * document").
 *
 * `pattern` is a semicolon-separated list of file extensions (for example,
 * "doc;docx"). File extensions may only contain alphanumeric characters,
 * hyphens, underscores and periods. Alternatively, the whole string can be a
 * single asterisk ("*"), which serves as an "All files" filter.
 *
 * @since This struct is available since SDL 3.2.0.

/**
 * Create and launch a file dialog with the specified properties.
 *
 * These are the supported properties:
 *
 * - `SDL_PROP_FILE_DIALOG_FILTERS_POINTER`: a pointer to a list of
 *   DialogFileFilter structs, which will be used as filters for
 *   file-based selections. Ignored if the dialog is an "Open Folder" dialog.
 *   If non-nullptr, the array of filters must remain valid at least until the
 *   callback is invoked.
 * - `SDL_PROP_FILE_DIALOG_NFILTERS_NUMBER`: the number of filters in the
 *   array of filters, if it exists.
 * - `SDL_PROP_FILE_DIALOG_WINDOW_POINTER`: the window that the dialog should
 *   be modal for.
 * - `SDL_PROP_FILE_DIALOG_LOCATION_STRING`: the default folder or file to
 *   start the dialog at.
 * - `SDL_PROP_FILE_DIALOG_MANY_BOOLEAN`: true to allow the user to select
 *   more than one entry.
 * - `SDL_PROP_FILE_DIALOG_TITLE_STRING`: the title for the dialog.
 * - `SDL_PROP_FILE_DIALOG_ACCEPT_STRING`: the label that the accept button
 *   should have.
 * - `SDL_PROP_FILE_DIALOG_CANCEL_STRING`: the label that the cancel button
 *   should have.
 *
 * Note that each platform may or may not support any of the properties.
 *
 * @param type the type of file dialog.
 * @param callback a function pointer to be invoked when the user selects a
 *                 file and accepts, or cancels the dialog, or an error
 *                 occurs.
 * @param props the properties to use.
 *
 * @threadsafety This function should be called only from the main thread. The
 *               callback may be invoked from the same thread or from a
 *               different one, depending on the OS's constraints.
 *
 * @since This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
