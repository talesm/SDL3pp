 * @defgroup CategoryInit Initialization and Shutdown
 *
 * All SDL programs need to initialize the library before starting to work
 * with it.
 *
 * Almost everything can simply call SDL_Init() near startup, with a handful
 * of flags to specify subsystems to touch. These are here to make sure SDL
 * does not even attempt to touch low-level pieces of the operating system
 * that you don't intend to use. For example, you might be using SDL for video
 * and input but chose an external library for audio, and in this case you
 * would just need to leave off the `SDL_INIT_AUDIO` flag to make sure that
 * external library has complete control.
 *
 * Most apps, when terminating, should call SDL_Quit(). This will clean up
 * (nearly) everything that SDL might have allocated, and crucially, it'll
 * make sure that the display's resolution is back to what the user expects if
 * you had previously changed it for your game.
 *
 * SDL3 apps are strongly encouraged to call SDL_SetAppMetadata() at startup
 * to fill in details about the program. This is completely optional, but it
 * helps in small ways (we can provide an About dialog box for the macOS menu,
 * we can name the app in the system's audio mixer, etc). Those that want to
 * provide a _lot_ of information should look at the more-detailed
 * SDL_SetAppMetadataProperty().
