/**

 *
 * # CategoryProperties
 *
 * A property is a variable that can be created and retrieved by name at
 * runtime.
 *
 * All properties are part of a property group (SDL_PropertiesID). A property
 * group can be created with the SDL_CreateProperties function and destroyed
 * with the SDL_DestroyProperties function.
 *
 * Properties can be added to and retrieved from a property group through the
 * following functions:
 *
 * - PropertiesBase.SetPointer() and PropertiesBase.GetPointer() operate on
 * `void*` pointer types.
 * - PropertiesBase.SetString() and PropertiesBase.GetString() operate on string
 * types.
 * - PropertiesBase.SetNumber() and PropertiesBase.GetNumber() operate on signed
 * 64-bit integer types.
 * - PropertiesBase.SetFloat() and PropertiesBase.GetFloat() operate on floating
 * point types.
 * - PropertiesBase.SetBoolean() and PropertiesBase.GetBoolean() operate on
 * boolean types.
 *
 * Properties can be removed from a group by using PropertiesBase.Clear().
