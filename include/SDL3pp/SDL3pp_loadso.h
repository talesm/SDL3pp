/**

 * @defgroup CategorySharedObject Shared Object/DLL Management
 *
 * System-dependent library loading routines.
 *
 * Shared objects are code that is programmatically loadable at runtime.
 * Windows calls these "DLLs", Linux calls them "shared libraries", etc.
 *
 * To use them, build such a library, then call SDL_LoadObject() on it. Once
 * loaded, you can use SDL_LoadFunction() on that object to find the address
 * of its exported symbols. When done with the object, call SDL_UnloadObject()
 * to dispose of it.
 *
 * Some things to keep in mind:
 *
 * - These functions only work on C function names. Other languages may have
 *   name mangling and intrinsic language support that varies from compiler to
 *   compiler.
 * - Make sure you declare your function pointers with the same calling
 *   convention as the actual library function. Your code will crash
 *   mysteriously if you do not do this.
 * - Avoid namespace collisions. If you load a symbol from the library, it is
 *   not defined whether or not it goes into the global symbol namespace for
 *   the application. If it does and it conflicts with symbols in your code or
 *   other shared libraries, you will not get the results you expect. :)
 * - Once a library is unloaded, all pointers into it obtained through
 *   SDL_LoadFunction() become invalid, even if the library is later reloaded.
 *   Don't unload a library if you plan to use these pointers in the future.
 *   Notably: beware of giving one of these pointers to atexit(), since it may
 *   call that pointer after the library unloads.
