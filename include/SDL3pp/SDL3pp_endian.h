/**
 * @defgroup CategoryEndian Byte Order and Byte Swapping
 *
 * Functions converting endian-specific values to different byte orders.
 *
 * These functions either unconditionally swap byte order (Swap16,
 * Swap32, Swap64, SwapFloat), or they swap to/from the system's
 * native byte order (Swap16LE, Swap16BE, Swap32LE, Swap32BE,
 * Swap32LE, Swap32BE, SwapFloatLE, SwapFloatBE). In the
 * latter case, the functionality is provided by macros that become no-ops if
 * a swap isn't necessary: on an x86 (littleendian) processor, Swap32LE
 * does nothing, but Swap32BE() reverses the bytes of the data. On a PowerPC
 * processor (bigendian), the macros behavior is reversed.
 *
 * The swap routines are inline functions, and attempt to use compiler
 * intrinsics, inline assembly, and other magic to make byteswapping
 * efficient.
