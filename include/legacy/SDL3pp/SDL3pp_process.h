 * terminate the process with ProcessRef.Kill().
 *
 * Don't forget to call Process.Destroy() to clean up, whether the process
 * process was killed, terminated on its own, or is still running!

 * If a standard I/O stream is set to PROCESS_STDIO_INHERITED, it will go
 * to the same place as the application's I/O stream. This is the default for
 * standard output and standard error.
 *
 * If a standard I/O stream is set to SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_NULL, it is connected
 * to `NUL:` on Windows and `/dev/null` on POSIX systems. This is the default
 * for standard input.
 *
 * If a standard I/O stream is set to PROCESS_STDIO_APP, it is connected to a
 * new IOStream that is available to the application. Standard input will be
 * available as `prop::process.STDIN_POINTER` and allows ProcessRef.GetInput(),
 * standard output will be available as `prop::process.STDOUT_POINTER` and
 * allows ProcessRef.Read() and ProcessRef.GetOutput(), and standard error will
 * be available as `prop::process.STDERR_POINTER` in the properties for the
 * created process.
 *
 * If a standard I/O stream is set to PROCESS_STDIO_REDIRECT, it is connected to
 * an existing IOStream provided by the application. Standard input is provided
 * using `prop::process.CREATE_STDIN_POINTER`, standard output is provided using
 * `prop::process.CREATE_STDOUT_POINTER`, and standard error is provided using
 * `prop::process.CREATE_STDERR_POINTER` in the creation properties. These
 * existing streams should be closed by the application once the new process is
 * created.
 *
 * In order to use an IOStream with PROCESS_STDIO_REDIRECT, it must have
 * `prop::IOStream.WINDOWS_HANDLE_POINTER` or
 * `prop::IOStream.FILE_DESCRIPTOR_NUMBER` set. This is true for streams
 * representing files and process I/O.
