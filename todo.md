Todo for some stability
=======================

Things for a version 0.1

- [x] C++ helpers and shims to better express the API intent:
  - [x] Implement [resource management](https://talesm.github.io/SDL3pp/group__CategoryObjectWrapper.html);
  - [x] Implement [helper](https://talesm.github.io/SDL3pp/classSDL_1_1StringParam.html)
    to transform `std::string`, `std::string_view` into `const char *`;
  - [x] Implement [helpers](https://talesm.github.io/SDL3pp/group__CategoryCallbackWrapper.html)
    to use C++ lambdas and function objects as [callbacks](https://talesm.github.io/SDL3pp/callback.html)
    on SDL;
  - [x] Wrap [RAII interface to SDL allocated pointers](https://talesm.github.io/SDL3pp/group__CategoryOwnPtr.html)
    returned by some SDL APIs;
  - [x] Implement [Optional reference-like type](https://talesm.github.io/SDL3pp/classSDL_1_1OptionalRef.html)
    for simulating an `std::optional<T&>`;
  - [x] Implement [span-like type](https://talesm.github.io/SDL3pp/classSDL_1_1SpanRef.html)
    compatible with our empty-derived structs we use to add methods to things
    like SDL_Rect.
