>    * The callback can (optionally) call AudioStreamRef.GetData() to obtain
>    * audio from the stream during this call.
>    *
>    * The callback's `additional_amount` argument is how many bytes of
>    * _converted_ data (in the stream's output format) was provided by the
>    * caller, although this may underestimate a little for safety. This value
>    * might be less than what is currently available in the stream, if data was
>    * already there, and might be less than the caller provided if the stream
>    * needs to keep a buffer to aid in resampling. Which means the callback may
>    * be provided with zero bytes, and a different amount on each call.
>    *
>    * The callback may call AudioStreamRef.GetAvailable to see the total amount
>    * currently available to read from the stream, instead of the total provided
>    * by the current call.
>    *
>    * The callback is not required to obtain all data. It is allowed to read less
>    * or none at all. Anything not read now simply remains in the stream for
>    * later access.
>    *
>    * Clearing or flushing an audio stream does not call this callback.
>    *
>    * This function obtains the stream's lock, which means any existing callback
>    * (get or put) in progress will finish running before setting the new
>    * callback.
