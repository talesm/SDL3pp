>    * The buffer is the final mix of all bound audio streams on an opened device;

>    *
>    * This callback is allowed to make changes to the data; the contents of the
>    * buffer after this call is what is ultimately passed along to the hardware.
>    *
>    * The callback is always provided the data in float format (values from -1.0f
>    * to 1.0f), but the number of channels or sample rate may be different than
>    * the format the app requested when opening the device; SDL might have had to

>    * new physical hardware when a system default changed, etc. These details may
>    * change between calls. Accordingly, the size of the buffer might change
>    * between calls as well.
>    *
>    * This callback can run at any time, and from any thread; if you need to
>    * serialize access to your app's data, you should provide and use a mutex or
>    * other synchronization device.
>    *
>    * All of this to say: there are specific needs this callback can fulfill, but
>    * it is not the simplest interface. Apps should generally provide audio in
>    * their preferred format through an AudioStream and let SDL handle the
>    * difference.
>    *
>    * This function is extremely time-sensitive; the callback should do the least
>    * amount of work possible and return as quickly as it can. The longer the

>    *
>    * This function will block until the audio device is in between iterations,
