+   * If all your app intends to do is provide a single source of PCM audio, this
+   * function allows you to do all your audio setup in a single call.
+   *
+   * This is also intended to be a clean means to migrate apps from SDL2.
+   *
+   * This function will open an audio device, create a stream and bind it.
+   * Unlike other methods of setup, the audio device will be closed when this
+   * stream is destroyed, so the app can treat the returned AudioStream as
+   * the only object needed to manage audio playback.
+   *
+   * Also unlike other functions, the audio device begins paused. This is to map
+   * more closely to SDL2-style behavior, since there is no extra step here to
+   * bind a stream to begin audio flowing. The audio device should be resumed
+   * with `AudioStream.ResumeDevice(stream);`
+   *
+   * This function works with both playback and recording devices.
+   *
+   * The `spec` parameter represents the app's side of the audio stream. That
+   * is, for recording audio, this will be the output format, and for playing
+   * audio, this will be the input format. If spec is nullptr, the system will
+   * choose the format, and the app can use AudioStream.GetFormat() to obtain
+   * this information later.
+   *
+   * If you don't care about opening a specific audio device, you can (and
+   * probably _should_), use AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK for playback and
+   * AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_RECORDING for recording.
+   *
+   * One can optionally provide a callback function; if nullptr, the app is
+   * expected to queue audio data for playback (or unqueue audio data if
+   * capturing). Otherwise, the callback will begin to fire once the device is
+   * unpaused.
+   *
+   * Destroying the returned stream with AudioStream.Destroy will also close
