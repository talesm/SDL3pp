>    * Convenience function for straightforward audio init for the common case.
>    *
>    * If all your app intends to do is provide a single source of PCM audio, this
>    * function allows you to do all your audio setup in a single call.
>    *
>    * This is also intended to be a clean means to migrate apps from SDL2.
>    *
>    * This function will open an audio device, create a stream and bind it.
>    * Unlike other methods of setup, the audio device will be closed when this
>    * stream is destroyed, so the app can treat the returned AudioStream as
>    * the only object needed to manage audio playback.
>    *
>    * Also unlike other functions, the audio device begins paused. This is to map
>    * more closely to SDL2-style behavior, since there is no extra step here to
>    * bind a stream to begin audio flowing. The audio device should be resumed
>    * with `AudioStream.ResumeDevice(stream);`
>    *
>    * This function works with both playback and recording devices.
>    *
>    * The `spec` parameter represents the app's side of the audio stream. That
>    * is, for recording audio, this will be the output format, and for playing
>    * audio, this will be the input format. If spec is nullptr, the system will
>    * choose the format, and the app can use AudioStream.GetFormat() to obtain
>    * this information later.
>    *
>    * If you don't care about opening a specific audio device, you can (and
>    * probably _should_), use AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK for playback and
>    * AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_RECORDING for recording.
>    *
>    * One can optionally provide a callback function; if nullptr, the app is
>    * expected to queue audio data for playback (or unqueue audio data if
>    * capturing). Otherwise, the callback will begin to fire once the device is
>    * unpaused.
>    *
>    * Destroying the returned stream with AudioStream.Destroy will also close
>    * the audio device associated with this stream.
>    *
>    * @param devid an audio device to open, or AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK
>    *              or AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_RECORDING.
>    * @param spec the audio stream's data format. Can be nullptr.
>    * @param callback a callback where the app will provide new data for
>    *                 playback, or receive new data for recording.
