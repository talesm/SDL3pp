 * SDL pen event handling.
 *
 * SDL provides an API for pressure-sensitive pen (stylus and/or eraser)
 * handling, e.g., for input and drawing tablets or suitably equipped mobile /
 * tablet devices.
 *
 * To get started with pens, simply handle SDL_EVENT_PEN_* events. When a pen
 * starts providing input, SDL will assign it a unique PenID, which will
 * remain for the life of the process, as long as the pen stays connected.
 *
 * Pens may provide more than simple touch input; they might have other axes,
 * such as pressure, tilt, rotation, etc.

 * consistent as long as SDL can recognize a tool to be the same pen; but if a
 * pen physically leaves the area and returns, it might get a new ID.
