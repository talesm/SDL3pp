   * Use this function to create a new IOStream structure for reading from

   * The `mode` string is treated roughly the same as in a call to the C
   * library's fopen(), even if SDL doesn't happen to use fopen() behind the
   * scenes.
   *
   * Available `mode` strings:
   *
   * - "r": Open a file for reading. The file must exist.
   * - "w": Create an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name
   *   already exists its content is erased and the file is treated as a new
   *   empty file.
   * - "wx": Create an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name
   *   already exists, the call fails.
   * - "a": Append to a file. Writing operations append data at the end of the
   *   file. The file is created if it does not exist.
   * - "r+": Open a file for update both reading and writing. The file must
   *   exist.
   * - "w+": Create an empty file for both reading and writing. If a file with
   *   the same name already exists its content is erased and the file is
   *   treated as a new empty file.
   * - "w+x": Create an empty file for both reading and writing. If a file with
   *   the same name already exists, the call fails.
   * - "a+": Open a file for reading and appending. All writing operations are
   *   performed at the end of the file, protecting the previous content to be
   *   overwritten. You can reposition (fseek, rewind) the internal pointer to
   *   anywhere in the file for reading, but writing operations will move it
   *   back to the end of file. The file is created if it does not exist.
   *
   * **NOTE**: In order to open a file as a binary file, a "b" character has to
   * be included in the `mode` string. This additional "b" character can either
   * be appended at the end of the string (thus making the following compound
   * modes: "rb", "wb", "ab", "r+b", "w+b", "a+b") or be inserted between the
   * letter and the "+" sign for the mixed modes ("rb+", "wb+", "ab+").
   * Additional characters may follow the sequence, although they should have no
   * effect. For example, "t" is sometimes appended to make explicit the file is
   * a text file.
   *
   * This function supports Unicode filenames, but they must be encoded in UTF-8
   * format, regardless of the underlying operating system.
   *
   * In Android, IOStream.FromFile() can be used to open content:// URIs. As a
   * fallback, IOStream.FromFile() will transparently open a matching filename
   * in the app's `assets`.
   *
   * Closing the IOStream will close SDL's internal file handle.
   *
   * The following properties may be set at creation time by SDL:
   *
   * - `prop::IOStream.WINDOWS_HANDLE_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast
   *   to a win32 `HANDLE`, that this IOStream is using to access the
   *   filesystem. If the program isn't running on Windows, or SDL used some
   *   other method to access the filesystem, this property will not be set.
   * - `prop::IOStream.STDIO_FILE_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast to a
   *   stdio `FILE *`, that this IOStream is using to access the filesystem.
   *   If SDL used some other method to access the filesystem, this property
   *   will not be set. PLEASE NOTE that if SDL is using a different C runtime
   *   than your app, trying to use this pointer will almost certainly result in
   *   a crash! This is mostly a problem on Windows; make sure you build SDL and
   *   your app with the same compiler and settings to avoid it.
   * - `prop::IOStream.FILE_DESCRIPTOR_NUMBER`: a file descriptor that this
   *   IOStream is using to access the filesystem.
   * - `prop::IOStream.ANDROID_AASSET_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast
   *   to an Android NDK `AAsset *`, that this IOStream is using to access
   *   the filesystem. If SDL used some other method to access the filesystem,
   *   this property will not be set.

 * scenes.
 *
 * Available `mode` strings:
 *
 * - "r": Open a file for reading. The file must exist.
 * - "w": Create an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name
 *   already exists its content is erased and the file is treated as a new
 *   empty file.
 * - "wx": Create an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name
 *   already exists, the call fails.
 * - "a": Append to a file. Writing operations append data at the end of the
 *   file. The file is created if it does not exist.
 * - "r+": Open a file for update both reading and writing. The file must
 *   exist.
 * - "w+": Create an empty file for both reading and writing. If a file with
 *   the same name already exists its content is erased and the file is
 *   treated as a new empty file.
 * - "w+x": Create an empty file for both reading and writing. If a file with
 *   the same name already exists, the call fails.
 * - "a+": Open a file for reading and appending. All writing operations are
 *   performed at the end of the file, protecting the previous content to be
 *   overwritten. You can reposition (fseek, rewind) the internal pointer to
 *   anywhere in the file for reading, but writing operations will move it
 *   back to the end of file. The file is created if it does not exist.
 *
 * **NOTE**: In order to open a file as a binary file, a "b" character has to
 * be included in the `mode` string. This additional "b" character can either
 * be appended at the end of the string (thus making the following compound

 * - `prop::IOStream.STDIO_FILE_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast to a
 *   stdio `FILE *`, that this IOStream is using to access the filesystem.
 *   If SDL used some other method to access the filesystem, this property
 *   will not be set. PLEASE NOTE that if SDL is using a different C runtime
 *   than your app, trying to use this pointer will almost certainly result in
 *   a crash! This is mostly a problem on Windows; make sure you build SDL and
 *   your app with the same compiler and settings to avoid it.
 * - `prop::IOStream.FILE_DESCRIPTOR_NUMBER`: a file descriptor that this
 *   IOStream is using to access the filesystem.
 * - `prop::IOStream.ANDROID_AASSET_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast
 *   to an Android NDK `AAsset *`, that this IOStream is using to access
 *   the filesystem. If SDL used some other method to access the filesystem,
