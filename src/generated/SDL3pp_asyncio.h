/**
 * @defgroup CategoryAsyncIO Category AsyncIO
 *
 * SDL offers a way to perform I/O asynchronously. This allows an app to read
 * or write files without waiting for data to actually transfer; the functions
 * that request I/O never block while the request is fulfilled.
 *
 * Instead, the data moves in the background and the app can check for results
 * at their leisure.
 *
 * This is more complicated than just reading and writing files in a
 * synchronous way, but it can allow for more efficiency, and never having
 * framerate drops as the hard drive catches up, etc.
 *
 * The general usage pattern for async I/O is:
 *
 * - Create one or more AsyncIOQueue objects.
 * - Open files with AsyncIO.AsyncIO.
 * - Start I/O tasks to the files with AsyncIO.Read or AsyncIO.Write,
 *   putting those tasks into one of the queues.
 * - Later on, use AsyncIOQueue.GetResult on a queue to see if any task is
 *   finished without blocking. Tasks might finish in any order with success
 *   or failure.
 * - When all your tasks are done, close the file with AsyncIO.Close. This
 *   also generates a task, since it might flush data to disk!
 *
 * This all works, without blocking, in a single thread, but one can also wait
 * on a queue in a background thread, sleeping until new results have arrived:
 *
 * - Call AsyncIOQueue.WaitResult from one or more threads to efficiently block
 *   until new tasks complete.
 * - When shutting down, call AsyncIOQueue.Signal to unblock any sleeping
 *   threads despite there being no new tasks completed.
 *
 * And, of course, to match the synchronous LoadFile, we offer
 * LoadFileAsync as a convenience function. This will handle allocating a
 * buffer, slurping in the file data, and null-terminating it; you still check
 * for results later.
 *
 * Behind the scenes, SDL will use newer, efficient APIs on platforms that
 * support them: Linux's io_uring and Windows 11's IoRing, for example. If
 * those technologies aren't available, SDL will offload the work to a thread
 * pool that will manage otherwise-synchronous loads without blocking the app.
 *
 * ## Best Practices
 *
 * Simple non-blocking I/O--for an app that just wants to pick up data
 * whenever it's ready without losing framerate waiting on disks to spin--can
 * use whatever pattern works well for the program. In this case, simply call
 * AsyncIO.Read, or maybe LoadFileAsync, as needed. Once a frame, call
 * AsyncIOQueue.GetResult to check for any completed tasks and deal with the
 * data as it arrives.
 *
 * If two separate pieces of the same program need their own I/O, it is legal
 * for each to create their own queue. This will prevent either piece from
 * accidentally consuming the other's completed tasks. Each queue does require
 * some amount of resources, but it is not an overwhelming cost. Do not make a
 * queue for each task, however. It is better to put many tasks into a single
 * queue. They will be reported in order of completion, not in the order they
 * were submitted, so it doesn't generally matter what order tasks are
 * started.
 *
 * One async I/O queue can be shared by multiple threads, or one thread can
 * have more than one queue, but the most efficient way--if ruthless
 * efficiency is the goal--is to have one queue per thread, with multiple
 * threads working in parallel, and attempt to keep each queue loaded with
 * tasks that are both started by and consumed by the same thread. On modern
 * platforms that can use newer interfaces, this can keep data flowing as
 * efficiently as possible all the way from storage hardware to the app, with
 * no contention between threads for access to the same queue.
 *
 * Written data is not guaranteed to make it to physical media by the time a
 * closing task is completed, unless AsyncIO.Close is called with its
 * `flush` parameter set to true, which is to say that a successful result
 * here can still result in lost data during an unfortunately-timed power
 * outage if not flushed. However, flushing will take longer and may be
 * unnecessary, depending on the app's needs.
