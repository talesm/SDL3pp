First, the\ncomponents of the source and destination pixels get multiplied with their\nblend factors. Then, the blend operation takes the two products and\ncalculates the result that will get stored in the render target.\n\nExpressed in pseudocode, it would look like this:\n\n```c\ndstRGB = colorOperation(srcRGB * srcColorFactor, dstRGB * dstColorFactor);\ndstA = alphaOperation(srcA * srcAlphaFactor, dstA * dstAlphaFactor);\n```\n\nWhere the functions `colorOperation(src, dst)` and `alphaOperation(src,\ndst)` can return one of the following:\n\n- `src + dst`\n- `src - dst`\n- `dst - src`\n- `min(src, dst)`\n- `max(src, dst)`\n\nThe red, green, and blue components are always multiplied with the first,\nsecond, and third components of the SDL_BlendFactor, respectively.

However, some\n  factors produce unexpected results with `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MINIMUM` and\n  `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MAXIMUM`.\n- **direct3d11**: Same as Direct3D 9.\n- **opengl**: Supports the `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD` operation with all\n  factors.
