More importantly, the SDL implementations work identically across\nplatforms, so apps can avoid surprises like snprintf() behaving differently\nbetween Windows and Linux builds, or itoa() only existing on some\nplatforms.\n\nFor many of the most common functions, like SDL_memcpy, SDL might just call\nthrough to the usual C runtime behind the scenes, if it makes sense to do\nso (if it's faster and always available/reliable on a given platform),\nreducing library size and offering the most optimized option.\n\nSDL also offers other C-runtime-adjacent functionality in this header that\neither isn't, strictly speaking, part of any C runtime standards, like\nSDL_crc32() and SDL_reinterpret_cast, etc. It also offers a few better\noptions, like SDL_strlcpy(), which functions as a safer form of strcpy().",

It can deal with expanding values: a\nGerman Eszett character can compare against two ASCII 's' chars and be\nconsidered a match, for example. A notable exception: it does not handle\nthe Turkish 'i' character; human language is complicated!\n\nDepending on your platform, \"wchar_t\" might be 2 bytes, and expected to be\nUTF-16 encoded (like Windows), or 4 bytes in UTF-32 format. Since this\nhandles Unicode, it expects the string to be well-formed and not a\nnull-terminated string of arbitrary bytes. Characters that are not valid\nUTF-16 (or UTF-32) are treated as Unicode character U+FFFD (REPLACEMENT\nCHARACTER), which is to say two strings of random bits may turn out to\nmatch if they convert to the same amount of replacement characters.\n\nNote that while this function might deal with variable-sized characters,\n`maxlen` specifies a _wchar_ limit! If the limit lands in the middle of a\nmulti-byte UTF-16 sequence, it may convert a portion of the final character\nto one or more Unicode character U+FFFD (REPLACEMENT CHARACTER) so as not\nto overflow a buffer.\n\n`maxlen` specifies a maximum number of wchar_t values to compare; if the\nstrings match to this number of wchar_t (or both have matched to a\nnull-terminator character before this number of bytes), they will be\nconsidered equal.\n\n@param str1 the first string to compare.

SDL\nunderstands two different color types, RGB and YCbCr, or in SDL also\nreferred to as YUV.\n\nRGB colors consist of red, green, and blue channels of color that are added\ntogether to represent the colors we see on the screen.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model\n\nYCbCr colors represent colors as a Y luma brightness component and red and\nblue chroma color offsets. This color representation takes advantage of the\nfact that the human eye is more sensitive to brightness than the color in\nan image. The Cb and Cr components are often compressed and have lower\nresolution than the luma component.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr\n\nWhen the color information in YCbCr is compressed, the Y pixels are left at\nfull resolution and each Cr and Cb pixel represents an average of the color\ninformation in a block of Y pixels. The chroma location determines where in\nthat block of pixels the color information is coming from.\n\nThe color range defines how much of the pixel to use when converting a\npixel into a color on the display. When the full color range is used, the\nentire numeric range of the pixel bits is significant. When narrow color\nrange is used, for historical reasons, the pixel uses only a portion of the\nnumeric range to represent colors.\n\nThe color primaries and white point are a definition of the colors in the\ncolor space relative to the standard XYZ color space.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space\n\nThe transfer characteristic, or opto-electrical transfer function (OETF),\nis the way a color is converted from mathematically linear space into a\nnon-linear output signals.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec._709#Transfer_characteristics\n\nThe matrix coefficients are used to convert between YCbCr and RGB colors.",

For example, in RGB24 data, each pixel is encoded in 3 bytes\n  (red, green, blue) in that order, and in ABGR32 data, each pixel is\n  encoded in 4 bytes alpha, blue, green, red) in that order. Use these\n  names if the property of a format that is important to you is the order\n  of the bytes in memory or on disk.\n- Names with a bit count per component, such as ARGB8888 and XRGB1555, are\n  \"packed\" into an appropriately-sized integer in the platform's native\n  endianness. For example, ARGB8888 is a sequence of 32-bit integers; in\n  each integer, the most significant bits are alpha, and the least\n  significant bits are blue. On a little-endian CPU such as x86, the least\n  significant bits of each integer are arranged first in memory, but on a\n  big-endian CPU such as s390x, the most significant bits are arranged\n  first. Use these names if the property of a format that is important to\n  you is the meaning of each bit position within a native-endianness\n  integer.\n- In indexed formats such as INDEX4LSB, each pixel is represented by\n  encoding an index into the palette into the indicated number of bits,\n  with multiple pixels packed into each byte if appropriate. In LSB\n  formats, the first (leftmost) pixel is stored in the least-significant\n  bits of the byte; in MSB formats, it's stored in the most-significant\n  bits. INDEX8 does not need LSB/MSB variants, because each pixel exactly\n  fills one byte.\n\nThe 32-bit byte-array encodings such as RGBA32 are aliases for the\nappropriate 8888 encoding for the current platform. For example, RGBA32 is\nan alias for ABGR8888 on little-endian CPUs like x86, or an alias for\nRGBA8888 on big-endian CPUs.\n\n@since This enum is available since SDL 3.2.0.",

First, the\ncomponents of the source and destination pixels get multiplied with their\nblend factors. Then, the blend operation takes the two products and\ncalculates the result that will get stored in the render target.\n\nExpressed in pseudocode, it would look like this:\n\n```c\ndstRGB = colorOperation(srcRGB * srcColorFactor, dstRGB * dstColorFactor);\ndstA = alphaOperation(srcA * srcAlphaFactor, dstA * dstAlphaFactor);\n```\n\nWhere the functions `colorOperation(src, dst)` and `alphaOperation(src,\ndst)` can return one of the following:\n\n- `src + dst`\n- `src - dst`\n- `dst - src`\n- `min(src, dst)`\n- `max(src, dst)`\n\nThe red, green, and blue components are always multiplied with the first,\nsecond, and third components of the SDL_BlendFactor, respectively. The\nfourth component is not used.\n\nThe alpha component is always multiplied with the fourth component of the\nSDL_BlendFactor.

You can create windows,\nmanage them in various ways, set them fullscreen, and get events when\ninteresting things happen with them, such as the mouse or keyboard\ninteracting with a window.\n\nThe video subsystem is also interested in abstracting away some\nplatform-specific differences in OpenGL: context creation, swapping\nbuffers, etc. This may be crucial to your app, but also you are not\nrequired to use OpenGL at all. In fact, SDL can provide rendering to those\nwindows as well, either with an easy-to-use\n[2D API](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryRender)\nor with a more-powerful\n[GPU API](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryGPU)\n. Of course, it can simply get out of your way and give you the window\nhandles you need to use Vulkan, Direct3D, Metal, or whatever else you like\ndirectly, too.\n\nThe video subsystem covers a lot of functionality, out of necessity, so it\nis worth perusing the list of functions just to see what's available, but\nmost apps can get by with simply creating a window and listening for\nevents, so start with SDL_CreateWindow() and SDL_PollEvent().",

If you code carefully, you can handle\nthese quirks without any platform-specific code, though:\n\n- On Windows, function pointers are specific to the current GL context;\n  this means you need to have created a GL context and made it current\n  before calling SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(). If you recreate your context or\n  create a second context, you should assume that any existing function\n  pointers aren't valid to use with it. This is (currently) a\n  Windows-specific limitation, and in practice lots of drivers don't suffer\n  this limitation, but it is still the way the wgl API is documented to\n  work and you should expect crashes if you don't respect it. Store a copy\n  of the function pointers that comes and goes with context lifespan.\n- On X11, function pointers returned by this function are valid for any\n  context, and can even be looked up before a context is created at all.\n  This means that, for at least some common OpenGL implementations, if you\n  look up a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-NULL result that\n  is _NOT_ safe to call. You must always make sure the function is actually\n  available for a given GL context before calling it, by checking for the\n  existence of the appropriate extension with SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported(),\n  or verifying that the version of OpenGL you're using offers the function\n  as core functionality.\n- Some OpenGL drivers, on all platforms, *will* return NULL if a function\n  isn't supported, but you can't count on this behavior. Check for\n  extensions you use, and if you get a NULL anyway, act as if that\n  extension wasn't available. This is probably a bug in the driver, but you\n  can code defensively for this scenario anyhow.\n- Just because you're on Linux/Unix, don't assume you'll be using X11.\n  Next-gen display servers are waiting to replace it, and may or may not\n  make the same promises about function pointers.\n- OpenGL function pointers must be declared `APIENTRY` as in the example\n  code.

If the text goes out of the window, it's gone.\n\nFor serious text rendering, there are several good options, such as\nSDL_ttf, stb_truetype, or other external libraries.\n\nOn first use, this will create an internal texture for rendering glyphs.\nThis texture will live until the renderer is destroyed.\n\nThe text is drawn in the color specified by SDL_SetRenderDrawColor().\n\n@param renderer the renderer which should draw a line of text.\n@param x the x coordinate where the top-left corner of the text will draw.\n@param y the y coordinate where the top-left corner of the text will draw.\n@param str the string to render.\n@returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for more\n         information.\n\n@threadsafety This function should only be called on the main thread.\n\n@since This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.\n\n@sa SDL_RenderDebugTextFormat\n@sa SDL_DEBUG_TEXT_FONT_CHARACTER_SIZE",
